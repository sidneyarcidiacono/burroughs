      <h4>So, what is it?</h4>
      <p>
        Artificial neural networks are machine learning systems that learn much
        in the same way as humans or other mammals. Through training, they learn
        to achieve goals in different ways by making mistakes, calculating their
        error, and then attempting the problem again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much like how all of us at one point in time figured out how to throw or kick a ball into
        a goal or to another person, the neural net takes a shot at a problem or goal, and uses what is called "backpropagation" to
        determine its misses. It then uses something called "forward propogation" to try again, having
        adjusted its approach to the problem, the same way you would decide how much energy to put into a second
        throw after missing the goal by a few feet the first time.

    While this neural net was trained on text input, our computers don't really understand this. They understand numbers.
    This means that the Burroughs-Generator isn't able to take grammatical or spelling feedback in the same way we can. Instead, the input
    it was given was turned into numbers, and it uses a series of mathematical functions to assign weights to these. Based on its performance,
    it is able to re-assign these weight values in order to learn from its mistakes. The diagram above shows the general architechture of a neural net
    with one input neuron, one output neuron, and three hidden layers: two with three neurons and one with two neurons.
    As the input values are passed through these hidden layers, the net is performing mathematical calculations to detmine the output based
    on the weights of the data.

        You may have heard of AI, machine learning, or neural networks before. These computing systems are being deeply explored because of their
        massive potential to revolutionize nearly everything: medicine, service industries, tech, defense,
        education, and many more. Machines being able to learn like humans may seem scary, but as you may have realized with the Burroughs-Generator,
        computers still have a long way to go before they can truly do all of the general tasks humans can. Emulating other humans is easy for us
        , but it took the V 2.0 network over 100,000 characters and hours of training to even begin to make sense.

        Still, neural networks are robust and flexible systems that can solve complex problems very effectively. They can make
        many tasks much easier, like deciding which combinations of chemicals are most likely to make an effective medicine, predicting what
        you're going to type next or what you meant to type when you make a spelling mistake. They're also great at making more complex predictions,
        like what content on Instagram will keep you online and engaged, or what Amazon products to recommend next time you log in!
