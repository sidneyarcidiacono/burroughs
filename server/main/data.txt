I was born in 1914 in a solid threestory brick house
in a large Midwest city My parents were comfortable My
father owned and ran a lumber business The house had a
lawn in front a back yard with a garden a fish pond and a
high wooden fence all around it I remember the lamplighter
lighting the gas streetlights and the huge black
shiny Lincoln and drives in the park on Sunday All the
props of a safe comfortable way of life that is now gone
forever I could put down one of those nostalgic routines
about the old German doctor who lived next door and the
rats running around in the back yard and my aunts electric
car and my pet toad that lived by the fish pond
Actually my earliest memories are colored by a fear
of nightmares I was afraid to be alone and afraid of the
dark and afraid to go to sleep because of dreams where a
supernatural horror seemed always on the point of taking
shape I was afraid some day the dream would still be there
when I woke up I recall hearing a maid talk about opium
and how smoking opium brings sweet dreams and I said
I will smoke opium when I grow up
I was subject to hallucinations as a child Once I woke
up in the early morning light and saw little men playing in
a block house I had made I felt no fear only a feeling of
stillness and wonder Another recurrent hallucination or
nightmare concerned animals in the wall and started
with the delirium of a strange undiagnosed fever that I
had at the age of four or five
I went to a progressive school with the future solid
citizens the lawyers doctors and businessmen of a large
Midwest town I was timid with the other children and
afraid of physical violence One aggressive little Lesbian
would pull my hair whenever she saw me I would like to
shove her face in right now but she fell off a horse and
broke her neck years ago
When I was about seven my parents decided to move
to the suburbs to get away from people They bought a
large house with grounds and woods and a fish pond where
there were squirrels instead of rats They lived there in a
comfortable capsule with a beautiful garden and cut off
from contact with the life of the city
I went to a private suburban high school I was not
conspicuously good or bad at sports neither brilliant nor
backward in studies I had a definite blind spot for mathematics
or anything mechanical I never liked competitive
team games and avoided these whenever possible I became
in fact a chronic malingerer I did like fishing hunting
and hiking I read more than was usual for an American
boy of that time and place Oscar Wilde Anatole
France Baudelaire even Cide I formed a romantic attachment
for another boy and we spent our Saturdays exploring
old quarries riding around on bicycles and fishing
in ponds and rivers
At this time I was greatly impressed by an autobiography
of a burglar called You Cant Win The author
claimed to have spent a good part of his life in jail It
sounded good to me compared with the dullness of a Midwest
suburb where all contact with life was shut out I saw
my friend as an ally a partner in crime We found an
abandoned factory and broke all the windows and stole a
chisel We were caught and our fathers had to pay the
damages After this my friend packed me in because the
relationship was endangering his standing with the group I
saw there was no compromise possible with the group the
others and I found myself a good deal alone
The environment was empty the antagonist hidden
and I drifted into solo adventures My criminal acts were
gestures unprofitable and for the most part unpunished I
would break into houses and walk around without taking
anything As a matter of fact I had no need for money
Sometimes I would drive around in the country with a 22
rifle shooting chickens I made the roads unsafe with reckless
driving until an accident from which I emerged
miraculously and portentously unscratched scared me into
normal caution
I went to one of the Big Three universities where I
majored in English literature for lack of interest in any
other subject I hated the University and I hated the town
it was in Everything about the place was dead The University
was a fake English setup taken over by the graduates
of fake English public schools I was lonely I knew no
one and strangers were regarded with distaste by the
closed corporation of the desirables
By accident I met some rich homosexuals of the international
queer set who cruise around the world bumping
into each other in queer joints from New York to
Cairo I saw a way of life a vocabulary references a
whole symbol system as the sociologists say But these
people were jerks for the most part and after an initial
period of fascination I cooled off on the setup
When I graduated without honors I had one hundred
fifty dollars per month in trust That was in the depression
and there were no jobs and I couldnt think of any job I
wanted in any case I drifted around Europe for a year or
so Remnants of the postwar decay lingered in Europe
US dollars could buy a good percentage of the inhabitants
of Austria male or female That was in 1936 and the
Nazis were closing in fast
I went back to the States With my trust fund I could
live without working or hustling I was still cut off from
life as I had been in the Midwest suburb I fooled around
taking graduate courses in psychology and JiuJitsu lessons
I decided to undergo psychoanalysis and continued
with it for three years Analysis removed inhibitions and
anxiety so that I could live the way I wanted to live Much
of my progress in analysis was accomplished in spite of my
analyst who did not like my orientation as he called it
He finally abandoned analytic objectivity and put me down
as an outandout con I was more pleased with the resuits
than he was
After being rejected on physical grounds from five
officertraining programs I was drafted into the Army and
certified fit for unlimited service I decided I was not going
to like the Army and copped out on my nuthouse record
 Id once got on a Van Gogh kick and cut off a finger
joint to impress someone who interested me at the time
The nuthouse doctors had never heard of Van Gogh They
put me down for schizophrenia adding paranoid type to
explain the upsetting fact that I knew where I was and who
was President of the US When the Army saw that diagnosis
they discharged me with the notation This man is
never to be recalled or reclassified
After parting company with the Army I took a vanety
of jobs You could have about any job you wanted at
that time I worked as a private detective an exterminator
a bartender I worked in factories and offices I played
around the edges of crime But my hundred and fifty dollars
per month was always there I did not have to have
money It seemed a romantic extravagance to jeopardize
my freedom by some token act of crime It was at this time
and under these circumstances that I came in contact with
junk became an addict and thereby gained the motivation
the real need for money I had never had before
The question is frequently asked Why does a man
become a drug addict
The answer is that he usually does not intend to become
an addict You dont wake up one morning and
decide to be a drug addict It takes at least three months
shooting twice a day to get any habit at all And you dont
really know what junk sickness is until you have had several
habits It took me almost six months to get my first
habit and then the withdrawal symptoms were mild I
think it no exaggeration to say it takes about a year and
several hundred injections to make an addict
The questions of course could be asked Why did
you ever try narcotics Why did you continue using it long
enough to become an addict You become a narcotics
addict because you do not have strong motivations in any
other direction Junk wins by default I tried it as a matter
of curiosity I drifted along taking shots when I could
score I ended up hooked Most addicts I have talked to
report a similar experience They did not start using drugs
for any reason they can remember They just drifted along
until they got hooked If you have never been addicted
you can have no clear idea what it means to need junk
with the addicts special need You dont decide to be an
addict One morning you wake up sick and youre an addict
I have never regretted my experience with drugs I
think I am in better health now as a result of using junk at
intervals than I would be if I had never been an addict
When you stop growing you start dying An addict never
stops growing Most users periodically kick the habit
which involves shrinking of the organism and replacement
of the junkdependent cells A user is in continual state of
shrinking and growing in his daily cycle of shotneed for
shot completed
Most addicts look younger than they are Scientists
recently experimented with a worm that they were able to
shrink by withholding food By periodically shrinking the
worm so that it was in continual growth the worms life
was prolonged indefinitely Perhaps if a junky could keep
himself in a constant state of kicking he would live to a
phenomenal age
Junk is a cellular equation that teaches the user facts
of general validity I have learned a great deal from using
junk I have seen life measured out in eyedroppers of
morphine solution I experienced the agonizing deprivation
of junk sickness and the pleasure of relief when junkthirsty
cells drank from the needle Perhaps all pleasure is
relief I have learned the cellular stoicism that junk teaches
the user I have seen a cell full of sick junkies silent and
immobile in separate misery They knew the pointlessness
of complaining or moving They knew that basically no
one can help anyone else There is no key no secret someone
else has that he can give you
I have learned the junk equation Junk is not like
alcohol or weed a means to increased enjoyment of life
Junk is not a kick It is a way of life
My first experience with junk was during the War
about 1944 or 1945 I had made the acquaintance of a
man named Norton who was working in a shipyard at the
time Norton whose real name was Morelli or something
like that had been discharged from the peacetime Army
for forging a pay check and was classified 4F for reasons
of bad character He looked like George Raft but was
taller Norton was trying to improve his English and
achieve a smooth affable manner Affability however did
not come natural to him In repose his expression was
sullen and mean and you knew he always had that mean
look when you turned your back
Norton was a hardworking thief and he did not feel
right unless he stole something every day from the shipyard
where he worked A tool some canned goods a pair of
overalls anything at all One day he called me up and said
he had stolen a Tommy gun Could I find someone to buy
it I said Maybe Bring it over
The housing shortage was getting under way I paid
fifteen dollars a week for a dirty apartment that opened
onto a companionway and never got any sunlight The
wallpaper was flaking off because the radiator leaked steam
when there was any steam in it to leak I had the windows
sealed shut against the cold with a caulking of newspapers
The place was full of roaches and occasionally I killed a
bedbug
I was sitting by the radiator a little damp from the
steam when I heard Nortons knock I opened the door
and there he was standing in the dark hail with a big parcel
wrapped in brown paper under his arm He smiled and
said Hello
I said Come in Norton and take off your coat
He unwrapped the Tommy gun and we assembled it
and snapped the firing pin
I said I would find someone to buy it
Norton said Oh heres something else I picked up
It was a flat yellow box with five onehalf grain syrettes
of morphine tartrate
This is just a sample he said indicating the morphine
Ive got fifteen of these boxes at home and I can
get more if you get rid of these
I said Ill see what I can do
At that time I had never used any junk and it did not
occur to me to try it I began looking for someone to buy
the two items and that is how I ran into Roy and Herman
I knew a young hoodlum from upstate New York who
was working as a shortorder cook in Rikers cooling off
as he explained I called him and said I had something to
get rid of and made an appointment to meet him in the
Angle Bar on Eighth Avenue near 42nd Street
This bar was a meeting place for 42nd Street hustlers
a peculiar breed of fourflushing wouldbe criminals They
are always looking for a setup man someone to plan
jobs and tell them exactly what to do Since no setup
man would have anything to do with people so obviously
inept unlucky and unsuccessful they go on looking
fabricating preposterous lies about their big scores cooling
off as dishwashers soda jerks waiters occasionally rolling
a drunk or a timid queer looking always looking for the
setup man with a big job who will say Ive been watching
you Youre the man I need for this setup Now
listen
Jack  through whom I met Roy and Herman  was
not one of these lost sheep looking for the shepherd with a
diamond ring and a gun in the shoulder holster and the
hard confident voice with overtones of connections fixes
setups that would make a stickup sound easy and sure of
success Jack was very successful from time to time and
would turn up in new clothes and even new cars He was
also an inveterate liar who seemed to lie more for himself
than for any visible audience He had a cleancut healthy
country face but there was something curiously diseased
about him He was subject to sudden fluctuations in weight
like a diabetic or a sufferer from liver trouble These
changes in weight were often accompanied by an uncontrollable
fit of restlessness so that he would disappear for
some days
The effect was uncanny You would see him one time
a freshfaced kid A week or so later he would turn up so
thin sallow and oldlooking you would have to look twice
to recognize him His face was lined with suffering in
which his eyes did not participate It was a suffering of his
cells alone He himself  the conscious ego that looked out
of the glazed alertcalm hoodlum eyes  would have nothing
to do with this suffering of his rejected other self a
suffering of the nervous system of flesh and viscera and
cells
He slid into the booth where I was sitting and ordered
a shot of whiskey He tossed it off put the glass down and
looked at me with his head tilted a little to one side and
back
Whats this guy got he said
A Tommy gun and about thirtyfive grains of morphine
The morphine I can get rid of right away but the
Tommy gun may take a little time
Two detectives walked in and leaned on the bar talking
to the bartender Jack jerked his head in their direction
The law Lets take a walk
I followed him out of the bar He walked through the
door sliding sideways Im taking you to someone who
will want the morphine he said You want to forget this
address
We went down to the bottom level of the Independent
Subway Jacks voice talking to his invisible audience
went on and on He had a knack of throwing his voice
directly into your consciousness No external noise
drowned him out Give me a thirtyeight every time lust
flick back the hammer and let her go Ill drop anyone at
five hundred feet Dont care what you say My brother has
two 30caliber machine guns stashed in Iowa
We got off the subway and began to walk on snowcovered
sidewalks between tenements
The guy owed me for a long time see I knew he
had it but he wouldnt pay so I waited for him when he
finished work I had a roll of nickels No one can hang
anything on you for carrying US currency Told me he
was broke I cracked his jaw and took my money off him
Two of his friends standing there but they kept out of it
Idve switched a blade on them
We were walking up tenement stairs The stairs were
made of worn black metal We stopped in front of a narrow
metalcovered door and Jack gave an elaborate knock
inclining his head to the floor like a safecracker The door
was opened by a large flabby middleaged queer with
tattooing on his forearms and even on the backs of his
hands
This is Joey Jack said and Joey said Hello theret
Jack pulled a fivedollar bill from his pocket and gave
it to Joey Get us a quart of Schenleys will you Joey
Joey put on an overcoat and went out
In many tenement apartments the front door opens
directly into the kitchen This was such an apartment and
we were in the kitchen
After Joey went out I noticed another man who was
standing there looking at me Waves of hostility and suspicion
flowed out from his large brown eyes like some sort
of television broadcast The effect was almost like a physical
impact The man was small and very thin his neck
loose in the collar of his shirt His complexion faded from
brown to a mottled yellow and pancake makeup had been
heavily applied in an attempt to conceal a skin eruption
His mouth was drawn down at the corners in a grimace of
petulant annoyance
Whos this he said His name I learned later was
Herman
Friend of mine Hes got some morphine he wants to
get rid of
Herman shrugged and turned out his hands I dont
think I want to bother really
Okay Jack said well sell it to someone else Come
on Bill
We went into the front room There was a small
radio a china Buddha with a votive candle in front of it
pieces of bricabrac A man was lying on a studio couch
He sat up as we entered the room and said hello and smiled
pleasantly showing discolored brownish teeth It was a
Southern voice with the accent of East Texas
Jack said Roy this is a friend of mine He Has some
morphine he wants to sell
The man sat up straighter and swung his legs off the
couch His jaw fell slackly giving his face a vacant look
The skin of his face was smooth and brown The cheekbones
were high and he looked Oriental His ears stuck out
at right angles from his asymmetrical skull The eyes were
brown and they had a peculiar brilliance as though points
of light were shining behind them The light in the room
glinted on the points of light in his eyes like an opal
How much do you have he asked me
Seventyfive half grain syrettes
The regular price is two dollars a grain he said
but syrettes go for a little less People want tablets Those
syrettes have too much water and you have to squeeze the
stuff out and cook it down He paused and his face went
blank I could go about onefifty a grain he said finally
I guess that will be okay I said
He asked how we could make contact and I gave him
my phone number
Joey came back with the whiskey and we all had a
drink Herman stuck his head in from the kitchen and said
to Jack Could I talk to you for a minute
I could hear them arguing about something Then
Jack came back and Herman stayed in the kitchen We all
had a few drinks and Jack began telling a story
My partner was going through the joint The guy was
sleeping and I was standing over him with a threefoot
length of pipe I found in the bathroom The pipe had a
faucet on the end of it see All of a sudden he comes up
and jumps straight out of bed running I let him have it
with the faucet end and he goes on running right out into
the other room the blood spurting out of his head ten feet
every time his heart beat He made a pumping motion
with his hand You could see the brain there and the
blood coming out of It Jack began to laugh uncontrollably
My girl was waiting out in the car She called me
hahaha  she called me  hahaha  a coldblooded
killer
He laughed until his face was purple
A few nights after meeting Roy and Herman I used
one of the syrettes which was my first experience with
junk A syrette is like a toothpaste tube with a needle on
the end You push a pin down through the needle; the pin
punctures the seal; and the syrette is ready to shoot
Morphine hits the backs of the legs first then the back
of the neck a spreading wave of relaxation slackening the
muscles away from the bones so that you seem to float
without outlines like lying in warm salt water As this
relaxing wave spread through my tissues I experienced a
strong feeling of fear I had the feeling that some horrible
image was just beyond the field of vision moving as I
turned my head so that I never quite saw it I felt nauseous;
I lay down and closed my eyes A series of pictures
passed like watching a movie A huge neonlighted cocktail
bar that got larger and larger until streets traffic and
street repairs were included in it; a waitress carrying a skull
on a tray; stars in the clear sky The physical impact of the
fear of death; the shutting off of breath; the stopping of
blood
I dozed off and woke up with a start of fear Next
mowing I vomited and felt sick until noon
Roy called that night
About what we were discussing the other night he
said I could go about four dollars per box and take five
boxes now Are you busy Ill come over to your place
Well come to some kind of agreement
A few minutes later he knocked at the door He had
on a Glen plaid suit and a dark coffeecolored shirt We
said hello He looked around blankly and said If you
dont mind Ill take one of those now
I opened the box He took out a syrette and injected it
into his leg He pulled up his pants briskly and took out
twenty dollars I put five boxes on the kitchen table
I think Ill take them out of the boxes he said Too
bulky
He began putting the syrettes in his coat pockets I
dont think theyll perforate this way he said Listen Ill
call you again in a day or so after I get rid of these and
have some more money He was adjusting his hat over his
asymmetrical skull Ill see you
Next day he was back He shot another syrette and
pulled out forty dollars I laid out ten boxes and kept
two
These are for me I said
He looked at me surprised You use it
Now and then
Its bad stuff he said shaking his head The worst
thing that can happen to a man We all think we can
control it at first Sometimes we dont want to control it
He laughed Ill take all you can get at this price
Next day he was back He asked if I didnt want to
change my mind about selling the two boxes I said no He
bought two syrettes for a dollar each shot them both and
left He said he had signed on for a twomonth trip
During the next month I used up the eight syrettes I
had not sold The fear I had experienced after using the
first syrette was not noticeable after the third; but still
from time to time after taking a shot I would wake up
with a start of fear After six weeks or so I gave Roy a
ring not expecting him to be back from his trip but then 1
heard his voice on the phone
I said Say do you have any to sell Of the material I
sold you before
There was a pause
Yees be said I can let you have six but the price
will have to be three dollars per You understand I dont
have many
Okay I said You know the way Bring it on over
It was twelve onehalf grain tablets in a thin glass
tube I paid him eighteen dollars and he apologized again
for the retail rate
Next day he bought two grains back
Its mighty hard to get now at any price He said
looking for a vein in his leg He finally hit a vein and shot
the liquid in with an air bubble If air bubbles could kill
you there wouldnt be a junky alive
Later that day Roy pointed out to me a drugstore
where they sold needles without any questions  very few
drugstores will sell them without a prescription He showed
me how to make a collar out of paper to fit the needle to
an eyedropper An eyedropper is easier to use than a regular
hypo especially for giving yourself vein shots
Several days later Roy sent me to see a doctor with a
story about kidney stones to hit him for a morphine prescription
The doctors wife slammed the door in my face
but Roy finally got past her and made the doctor for a tengrain
script
The doctors office was in junk territory on 102nd off
Broadway He was a doddering old man and could not
resist the junkies who filled his office and were in fact his
only patients It seemed to give him a feeling of importance
to look out and see an office full of people I guess he had
reached a point where he could change the appearance of
things to suit his needs and when he looked out there he
saw a distinguished and diversified clientele probably welldressed
in 1910 style instead of a bunch of rattylooking
junkies come to hit him for a morphine script
Roy shipped out at two or threeweek intervals His
trips were Army Transport and generally short When he
was in town we generally split a few scripts The old
croaker on 102nd finally lost his mind altogether and no
drugstore would fill his scripts but Roy located an Italian
doctor out in the Bronx who would write
I was taking a shot from time to time but I was a
long way from having a habit At this time I moved into an
apartment on the Lower East Side It was a tenement
apartment with the front door opening into the kitchen
I began dropping into the Angle Bar every night and
saw quite a bit of Herman I managed to overcome his
original bad impression of me and soon I was buying his
drinks and meals and he was hitting me for smash
change at regular intervals Herman did not have a habit
at this time In fact he seldom got a habit unless someone
else paid for it But he was always high on something
weed benzedrine or knocked out of his mind on goof
balls He showed up at the Angle every night with a big
slob of a Polack called Whitey There were four Whities in
the Angle set which made for confusion This Whitey
combined the sensitivity of a neurotic with a psychopaths
readiness for violence He was convinced that nobody liked
him a fact that seemed to cause him a great deal of worry
One Tuesday night Roy and I were standing at the
end of the Angle bar Subway Mike was there and Frankie
Dolan Dolan was an Irish bay with a cast in one eye He
specialized in crummy scores beating up defenseless
drunks and holding out on his confederates I got no
honor he would say Im a rat And he would giggle
Subway Mike had a large pale face and long teeth
He looked like some specialized kind of underground animal
that preys on the animals of the surface lie was a
skillful lushworker but he had no front Any cop would
do a doubletake at sight of him and he was well known to
the subway squad So Mike spent at least half of his time
on the Island doing the fivetwentynine for jostling
This night Herman was knocked out on nembies
and his head kept falling down onto the bar Whitey was
stomping up and down the length of the bar trying to
promote some free drinks The boys at the bar sat rigid and
tense clutching their drinks quickly pocketing their
change I heard Whitey say to the bartender Keep this for
me will you and he passed his large clasp knife across
the bar The boys sat there silent and gloomy under the
fluorescent lights They were all afraid of Whitey all except
Roy Roy sipped his beer grimly His eyes shone with
their peculiar phosphorescence His long asymmetrical
body was draped against the bar He didnt look at Whitey
but at the opposite wall where the booths were located
Once he said to me Hes no more drunk than I am Hes
just thirsty
Whitey was standing in the middle of the bar his fists
doubled up tears streaming down his face Im no good
he said Im no good Cant anyone understand I dont
know what Im doing
The boys tried to get as far away from him as possible
without attracting his attention
Subway Slim Mikes occasional partner came in and
ordered a beer He was tall and bony and his ugly face
had a curiously inanimate look as if made out of wood
Whitey slapped him on the back and I heard Slim say
For Christs sake Whitey There was more interchange I
didnt hear Somewhere along the line Whitey must have
got his knife back from the bartender He got behind Slim
and suddenly pushed his hand against Slims back Slim fell
forward against the bar groaning I saw Whitey walk to
the front of the bar and look around He closed his knife
and slipped it into his packet
Roy said Lets go
Whitey had disappeared and the bar was empty except
for Mike who was holding Slim up on one side Frankie
Dolan was on the other
1 heard next day from Frankie that Slim was okay
The croaker at the hospital said the knife just missed a
kidney
Roy said The big slob I can see a real muscle man
but a guy like that going around picking up dimes and
quarters off the bar I was ready for him I was going to
kick him in the belly first then get one of those quart beer
bottles from the case on the floor and break it over his
sconce With a big villain like that youve got to use
strategy
We were all barred from the Angle which shortly
afterwards changed its name to the Roxy Grill
One night I went to the Henry Street address to look
up Jack A tall redhaired girl met me at the door
Im Mary she said Come in
It seemed that Jack was in Washington on business
Come on into the front room she said pushing
aside a red corduroy curtain I talk to landlords and bill
collectors in the kitchen We live in here
I looked around The bricabrac had gone The place
looked like a chop suey joint There were black and red
lacquered tables scattered around black curtains covered
the window A colored wheel had been painted on the
ceiling with little squares and triangles of different colors
giving a mosaic effect
Jack did that Mary said painting to the wheel
You should have seen him He stretched a board between
two ladders and lay down on it Paint kept dripping into
his face He gets a kick out of doing things like that We
get some frantic kicks out of that wheel when were high
We lay on our backs and dig the wheel and pretty soon it
begins to spin The longer you watch it the faster it spins
This wheel had the nightmarish vulgarity of Aztec
mosaics the bloody vulgar nightmare the heart throbbing
in the morning sun the garish pinks and blues of souvenir
ashtrays postcards and calendars The walls were painted
black and there was a Chinese character in red lacquer on
one wall
We dont know what it means she said
Shirts thirtyone cents I suggested
She turned on me her blank cold smile She began
talking about Jack Im queer for Jack she said He
works at being a thief just like any job Used to come
home nights and hand me his gun `Stash that He likes to
work around the house painting and making furniture
As she talked she moved around the room throwing
herself from one chair to another crossing and uncrossing
her legs adjusting her slip so as to give me a view of her
anatomy in installments
She went on to tell me how her days were numbered
by a rare disease Only twentysix cases on record In a
few years I wont be able to get around at all You see my
system cant absorb calcium and the bones are slowly dissolving
My legs will have to be amputated eventually then
the arms
There was something boneless about her like a deepsea
creature Her eyes were cold fish eyes that looked at
you through a viscous medium she carried about with her
I could see those eyes in a shapeless protoplasmic mass
undulating over the dark sea floor
Benzedrine is a good kick she said Three strips of
the paper or about ten tablets Or take two strips of benny
and two goof balls They get down there and have a fight
Its a good drive
Three young hoodlums from Brooklyn drifted in
woodenfaced handsinpockets stylized as a ballet They
were looking for Jack He had given them a short count in
some deal At least that was the general idea They conveyed
their meaning less by words than by significant jerks
of the head and by stalking around the apartment and
leaning against the walls At length one of them walked to
the door and jerked his head They filed out
Would you like to get high Mary asked There
may be a roach around here somewhere She began rummaging
around in drawers and ashtrays No I guess not
Why dont we go uptown I know several good connections
we can probably catch about now
A young man lurched in with some object wrapped in
brown paper under one arm Ditch this on your way out
he said putting it down on the table He staggered into the
bedroom on the other side of the kitchen When we got
outside I let the wrapping paper fall loose revealing the
coin box of a pay toilet crudely jimmied open
In Times Square we got into a taxi and began cruising
up and down the side streets Mary giving directions Every
now and then she would yell Stop and jump out her red
hair streaming and I would see her overhaul some character
and start talking The connection was here about ten
minutes ago This characters holding but he wont turn
loose of any Later The regular connection is gone for
the night He lives in the Bronx But just stop here for a
minute I may find someone in Kelloggs Finally No
one seems to be anywhere Its a bit late to score Lets buy
some benny tubes and go over to Ronnies They have
some gone numbers on the box We can order coffee and
get high on benny
Ronnies was a spot near 52nd and Sixth where musicians
came for fried chicken and coffee after one pm We
sat down in a booth and ordered coffee Mary cracked a
benzedrine tube expertly extracting the folded paper and
handed me three strips Roll it up into a pill and wash it
down with coffee
The paper gave off a sickening odor of menthol Several
people sitting nearby sniffed and smiled I nearly
gagged on the wad of paper but finally got it down Mary
selected some gone numbers and beat on the table with the
expression of a masturbating idiot
I began talking very fast My mouth was dry and my
spit came out in round white balls  spitting cotton its
called We were walking around Times Square Mary
wanted to locate someone with a piccolo victrola I
was full of expansive benevolent feelings and suddenly
wanted to call on people I hadnt seen in months or even
years people I did not like and who did not like me We
made a number of unsuccessful attempts to locate the ideal
piccoloowning host Somewhere along the line we picked
up Peter and finally decided to go back to the Henry Street
apartment where there was at least a radio
Peter and Mary and I spent the next thirty hours in
the apartment From time to time we would make coffee
and swallow more benzedrine Mary was describing the
techniques she used to get money from the Johns who
formed her principal source of revenue
Always build a John up If he has any sort of body
at all say `Oh dont ever hurt me A John is different
from a sucker When youre with a sucker youre on the
alert all the time You give him nothing A sucker is just to
be taken But a John is different You give him what he
pays for When youre with him you enjoy yourself and
you want him to enjoy himself too
If you want to really bring a man down light a
cigarette in the middle of intercourse Of course I really
dont like men at all sexually What I really dig is chicks 1
get a kick out of taking a proud chick and breaking her
spirit making her see she is just an animal A chick is
never beautiful after shes been broken Say this is sort of a
fireside kick she said pointing to the radio which was the
only light in the room
Her face contorted into an expression of monkeylike
rage as she talked about men who accosted her on the
street Sonofabitch she snarled They can tell when a
woman isnt looking for a pickup I used to cruise around
with brass knuckles on under my gloves just waiting for
one of those peasants to crack at me
One day Herman told me about a kilo of firstclass
New Orleans weed I could pick up for seventy dollars
Pushing weed looks good on paper like fur farming or
raising frogs At seventyfive cents a stick seventy sticks to
the ounce it sounded like money I was convinced and
bought the weed
Herman and I formed a partnership to push the weed
He located a Lesbian named Marian who lived in the Village
and said she was a poetess We kept the weed in
Marians apartment turned her on for all she could use
and gave her fifty percent on sales She knew a lot of tea
heads Another Lesbian moved in with her and every time
I went to Marians apartment there was this huge redhaired
Lizzie watching me with her cold fish eyes full of
stupid hate
One day the redhaired Lizzie opened the door and
stood there her face dead white and puffy with nembutal
sleep She shoved the package of weed at me Take this
and get out she said Youre both mother fuckers She
was half asleep Her voice was matteroffact as if referring
to actual incest
I said Tell Marian thanks for everything
She slammed the door The noise evidently woke her
up She opened the door again and began screaming with
hysterical rage We could still hear her out on the street
Herman contacted other tea heads They all gave us
static In practice pushing weed is a headache To begin
with weed is bulky You need a full suitcase to realize any
money If the cops start kicking your door in its like being
with a bale of alfalfa
Tea heads are not like junkies A junky hands you the
money takes his junk and cuts But tea heads dont do
things that way They expect the peddler to light them up
and sit around talking for half an hour to sell two dollars
worth of weed If you come right to the point they say you
are a bring down In fact a peddler should not come
right out and say he is a peddler No he just scores for a
few good cats and chicks because he is viperish
Everyone knows that he himself is the connection but it is
bad form to say so God knows why To me tea heads are
unfathomable
There are a lot of trade secrets in the tea business and
tea heads guard these supposed secrets with imbecilic slyness
For example tea must be cured or it is green and
rasps the throat But ask a tea head how to cure weed and
he will give you a sly stupid look and comeon with some
doubletalk Perhaps weed does affect the brain with constant
use or maybe tea heads are naturally silly
The tea I had was green so I put it in a double boiler
and set the boiler in the oven until the tea got the greenishbrown
look it should have This is the secret of curing tea
or at least one way to do it
Tea heads are gregarious they are sensitive and they
are paranoiac If you get to be known as a drag or a
bring down you cant do business with them I soon
found out I couldnt get along with these characters and I
was glad to find someone to take the tea off my hands at
cost I decided right then I would never push any more
tea
In 1937 weed was placed under the Harrison Narcotics
Act Narcotics authorities claim it is a habitforming
drug that its use is injurious to mind and body and that it
causes the people who use it to commit crimes Here are
the facts Weed is positively not habitforming You can
smoke weed for years and you will experience no discomfort
if your supply is suddenly cut off I have seen tea
heads in jail and none of them showed withdrawal symptoms
I have smoked weed myself off and on for fifteen
years and never missed it when I ran out There is less
habit to weed than there is to tobacco Weed does not
harm the general health In fact most users claim it gives
you an appetite and acts as a tonic to the system I do not
know of any other agent that gives as definite a boot to the
appetite I can smoke a stick of tea and enjoy a glass of
California sherry and a hash house meal
I once kicked a junk habit with weed The second day
off junk I sat down and ate a full meal Ordinarily I cant
eat for eight days after kicking a habit
Weed does not inspire anyone to commit crimes I
have never seen anyone get nasty under the influence of
weed Tea heads are a sociable lot Too sociable for my
liking I cannot understand why the people who claim
weed causes crimes do not follow through and demand the
outlawing of alcohol Every day crimes are committed by
drunks who would not have committed the crime sober
There has been a lot said about the aphrodisiac effect
of weed For some reason scientists dislike to admit that
there is such a thing as an aphrodisiac so most pharmacologists
say there is no evidence to support the popular
idea that weed possesses aphrodisiac properties I can say
definitely that weed is an aphrodisiac and that sex is more
enjoyable under the influence of weed than without it
Anyone who has used good weed will verify this statement
You hear that people go insane from using weed
There is in fact a form of insanity caused by excessive use
of weed The condition is characterized by ideas of reference
The weed available in the US is evidently not strong
enough to blow your top on and weed psychosis is rare in
the States In the Near East it is said to be common Weed
psychosis corresponds more or less to delirium tremens and
quickly disappears when the drug is withdrawn Someone
who smokes a few cigarettes a day is no more likely to go
insane than a man who takes a few cocktails before dinner
is likely to come down with the DTs
One thing about weed A man under the influence of
weed is completely unfit to drive a car Weed disturbs your
sense of time and consequently your sense of spatial relations
Once in New Orleans I had to pull over to the side
of a road and wait until the weed wore off I could not tell
how far away anything was or when to turn or put on the
brakes for an intersection
I was shooting every day now Herman had moved
into my apartment on Henry Street since there was no one
left to pay the rent for the apartment he had shared with
Jack and Mary Jack had taken a fall on a safe job and was
in the Bronx County jail awaiting trial Mary had gone to
Florida with a John It would not have occurred to
Herman to pay the rent himself He had lived in other
peoples apartments all his life
Roy was giving himself a long shore leave He located
a doctor in Brooklyn who was a writing fool This croaker
would go three scripts a day for as high as thirty tablets a
script Every now and then he would get dubious on the
deal but the sight of money always straightened him out
There are several varieties of writing croakers Some
will write only if they are convinced you are an addict
others only if they are convinced you are not Most addicts
put down a story worn smooth by years of use Some claim
gallstones or kidney stones This is the story most generally
used and a croaker will often get up and open the door as
soon as you mention gallstones I got better results with
facial neuralgia after I had looked up the symptoms and
committed them to memory Roy had an operation scar on
his stomach that he used to support his gallstone routine
There was one oldtime doctor who lived in a Victorian
brownstone in the West Seventies With him it was
simply necessary to present a gentlemanly front If you
could get into his inner office you had it made but he
would write only three prescriptions Another doctor was
always drunk and it was a matter of catching him at the
right time Often he wrote the prescription wrong and you
had to take it back for correction Then like as not he
would say the prescription was a forgery and tear it up
Still another doctor was senile and you had to help him
write the script He would forget what he was doing put
down the pen and go into a long reminiscence about the
high class of patients he used to have Especially he liked
to talk about a man named General Gore who once said to
him Doctor Ive been to the Mayo Clinic and you know
more than the whole clinic put together There was no
stopping him and the exasperated addict was forced to
listen patiently Often the doctors wife would rush in at
the last minute and tear up the prescription or refuse to
verify it when the drugstore called
Generally speaking old doctors are more apt to write
than the young ones Refugee doctors were a good field for
a while but the addicts burned them down Often a doctor
will blow his top at the mention of narcotics and threaten
to call the law
Doctors are so exclusively nurtured on exaggerated
ideas of their position that generally speaking a factual
approach is the worst possible Even though they do not
believe your story nonetheless they want to hear one It is
like some Oriental facesaving ritual One man plays the
highminded doctor who wouldnt write an unethical script
for a thousand dollars the other does his best to act like a
legitimate patient If you say Look Doe I want an MS
script and Im willing to pay double price for it the
croaker blows his top and throws you out of the office
You need a good bedside manner with doctors or you will
get nowhere
Roy was such a junk hog that Herman and I had to
shoot more than we needed to keep up with him and get
our share I began shooting in the main line to save stuff
and because the immediate kick was better We were having
trouble filling the scripts Most drugstores will only fill
a morphine script once or twice many not at all There
was one drugstore that would fill all our scripts anytime
and we took them all there though Roy said we ought to
spread them out so they would be harder for the inspector
to find It was too much trouble to walk around from
drugstore to drugstore so we usually ended up taking them
to the same place I was learning to hide my stuff carefully
 stash it as they say in the trade  so Roy and Herman
couldnt find it and take some
Taking junk hidden by another junky is known as
making him for his stash It is difficult to guard against
this form of theft because junkies know where to look for a
stash Some people carry their junk around with them but
a man who does that is subject to a charge of possession in
the event of search by the law
As I began using stuff every day or often several
times a day I stopped drinking and going out at night
When you use junk you dont drink Seemingly the body
that has a quantity of junk in its cells will not absorb
alcohol The liquor stays in the stomach slowly building
up nausea discomfort and dizziness and there is no kick
Using junk would be a sure cure for alcoholics I also
stopped bathing When von use junk the feel of water on
the skin is unpleasant for some reason and junkies are
reluctant to take a bath
A lot of nonsense has been written about the changes
people undergo as they get a habit All of a sudden the
addict looks in the mirror and does not recognize himself
The actual changes are difficult to specify and they do not
show up in the mirror That is the addict himself has a
special blind spot as far as the progress of his habit is
concerned He generally does not realize that he is getting
a habit at all He says there is no need to get a habit if you
are careful and observe a few rules like shooting every
other day Actually he does not observe these rules but
every extra shot is regarded as exceptional I have talked to
many addicts and they all say they were surprised when
they discovered they actually had the first habit Many of
them attributed their symptoms to some other cause
As a habit takes hold other interests lose importance
to the user Life telescopes down to junk one fix and
looking forward to the next stashes and scripts
spikes and droppers The addict himself often feels
that he is leading a normal life and that junk is incidental
He does not realize that he is just going through the motions
in his nonjunk activities It is not until his supply is
cut off that he realizes what junk means to him
Why do you need narcotics Mr Lee is a question
that stupid psychiatrists ask The answer is I need junk to
get out of bed in the morning to shave and eat breakfast I
need it to stay alive
Of course junkies dont as a rule die from the withdrawal
of junk But in a very literal sense kicking a habit
involves the death of junkdependent cells and their replacement
with cells that do not need junk
Roy and his old lady moved into the same tenement
building Every day we would meet in my apartment after
breakfast to plan the days junk program One of us would
have to hit the croaker Roy always tried to put it on
someone else I cant go myself this time 1 had a beef
with him But listen Ill tell you just what to say Or he
would try to get Herman or me to try a new croaker You
cant miss Just dont let him say no because he will write
I cant go myself
I had one of his surething croakers reach for a telephone
on me I told Roy and he said Oh I guess the
guys burned Somebody made him for his bag a few days
ago After that I kept away from strange croakers But
our Brooklyn boy was getting balky
All croakers pack in sooner or later One day when
Roy came for his script the doctor told him This is
positively the last and you guys had better keep out of
sight The inspector was around to see me yesterday He
has all the Rxes I wrote for you guys He told me Ill lose
my license if I write any more so Im going to date this
one back Tell the druggist you were too sick yesterday to
cash it You guys gave some wrong addresses on those
scripts Thats a violation of Public Health Law 334 so
dont say I didnt warn you For Gods sake cover up for
me if they question you This could mean my whole professional
career You know Ive always been right with you
boys I wanted to stop months ago I just couldnt leave
you guys stranded So give me a break Heres the script
and dont come back
Roy went back the next day The doctors brotherinlaw
was there to protect the family honor He grabbed Roy
by the coat collar and the back of the belt and threw him
out on the sidewalk
The next time I find you around here bothering the
doctor he said you wont be in a condition to walk
away
Ten minutes later Herman arrived The brotherinlaw
was giving him the same treatment when Herman
pulled out a silk dress he had under his coat  as I recall
somebody unloaded a batch of hot dresses on us for three
grains of morphine  and turning to the doctors wife who
had come downstairs to see what all the commotion was
about he said I thought you might like this dress So he
got a chance to talk to the doctor who wrote one last
script It took him three hours to fill it Our regular drugstore
had been warned by the inspector and they would
not fill any more scripts
You guys had better keep out of sight the proprietor
said I think the inspector has warrants out for all of
you
Our croaker had packed in We split up to comb the
city We covered Brooklyn the Bronx Queens Jersey City
and Newark We couldnt even score for pantopon It
seemed like the doctors were all expecting us just waiting
for one of us to walk into the office so they could say
Absolutely no It was as though every doctor in Greater
New York had suddenly taken a pledge never to write
another narcotics script We were running out of junk
Patently we would be immobilized in a matter of hours
Roy decided to throw in the towel and go to Rikers Island
for the thirtyday cure This is not a reduction cure
They dont give any junk not even a sleeping tablet All
they offer the addict is thirty days detention The place is
always full
Herman got picked up in the Bronx while he was
looking for a croaker No definite charge just two detectives
didnt like his looks When they got him downtown
they found out the narcotics squad had a warrant for him
sworn out by the State Inspector The charge was wrong
address on a narcotics script Some wagonchasing lawyer
called me up and asked if I would put up the money to buy
Herman a bond I sent two dollars for cigarettes instead If
a mans going to do time he might as well start doing it
I was all out of junk at this point and had doubleboiled
my last cottons Junk is cooked up in a spoon and
sucked into the dropper through a little piece of cotton to
get it all out of the spoon Some of the solution stays in the
cotton and addicts save these cottons for emergencies
I got a codeine script from an old doctor by putting
down a story about migraine headaches Codeine is better
than nothing and five grains in the skin will keep you from
being sick For some reason it is dangerous to shoot codeine
in the vein
I recall one night when Herman and I were caught
short with nothing but some codeine sulphate Herman
cooked up first and shot one grain in the vein Immediately
he turned very red then very pale He sat down weakly on
the bed My God he said
Whats the matter I asked Its perfectly all right
He gave me a sour look All right is it Well you
shoot some then
I cooked up a grain and got out my works ready to
take the shot Herman watched me eagerly He was still
sitting on the bed As soon as I took the needle out of my
arm I felt an intense and most unpleasant prickling sensation
entirely different from the prickles you get from a
good shot of morphine I could feel my face swelling I sat
down on the bed next to Herman My fingers were puffed
up double size
Well said Herman is it all right
No I said
My lips were numb like Id been hit across the mouth
I had a terrific headache I began to pace up and down the
room since I had a vague theory that if I got the circulation
going the blood would carry away the codeine
After an hour I felt a little better and went to bed
Herman told me about a partner of his who passed out and
turned blue after a shot of codeine I put him under a
cold shower and he came around
Why didnt you tell me that before I demanded
Herman was suddenly and unaccountably irritated
The sources of his anger were generally unfathomable
Well he began you have to expect to take some
chances when youre using junk Besides just because one
person has a certain reaction doesnt necessarily mean that
someone else will react in the same way You seemed so
sure it was all right I didnt want to bug you by bringing
anything up
When I heard one day that Herman had been arrested
I figured I would be next but I was already sick and did
not have the encrgy to leave town
I was arrested at my apartment by two detectives and
a Federal agent The State Inspector had sworn out a warrant
charging me with violation of Public Health Law 334
for giving a wrong name on a prescription The two detectives
were the conman and toughguy team The conman
was asking me How long you been using junk Bill You
know you ought to give a right name on those scripts
Then the toughguy would break in Come on come on
were not boy scouts
But they were not much interested in the case and a
statement from me was not necessary On the way downtown
the Federal man asked me some questions and filled
out a form for their records I was taken to the Tombs
mugged and fingerprinted While I was waiting to go before
the judge the conman gave me a cigarette and began
telling me what a bad deal junk is
Even if you get by with it thirty years youre only
kidding yourself Now you take these sex degenerates
his eyes glistened  the doctors say they cant help themselves
The judge set bail at a thousand I was taken back to
the Tombs ordered to take off my clothes and get under
the shower An apathetic guard poked through my clothes
I got dressed again went up in the elevator and was assigned
to a cell At four pm we were locked in our cells
The doors closed automatically from a master switch with
a tremendous clang that echoed through the cellblock
The last of the codeine was running out My nose and
eyes began to run sweat soaked through my clothes Hot
and cold flashes hit me as though a furnace door was
swinging open and shut I lay down on the bunk too weak
to move My legs ached and twitched so that any position
was intolerable and I moved from one side to the other
slashing about in my sweaty clothes
A Negro voice was singing Get up get up woman
off your big fat rustydusty Voices drift& back and forth
Forty years Man I cant do no forty years
At twelve that night my old lady bailed me out and
met me at the door with some goof balls Goof balls help a
little
Next day I was worse and could not get out of bed So
I stayed in bed taking nembies at intervals
At night I would take two strips of benzedrine and go
out to a bar where I sat right by the jukebox When youre
sick music is a great help Once in Texas I kicked a habit
on weed a pint of paregoric and a few Louis Armstrong
records
Almost worse than the sickness is the depression that
goes with it One afternoon I closed my eyes and saw New
York in ruins Huge centipedes and scorpions crawled in
and out of empty bars and cafeterias and drugstores on
Fortysecond Street Weeds were growing up through
cracks and holes in the pavement There was no one in
sight
After five days I began to feel a little better After
eight days I got the chucks and developed a tremendous
appetite for cream puffs and macaroons In ten days the
sickness had gone My case had been postponed
Roy came back from his thirtyday cure on Rikers
Island and introduced me to a peddler who was pushing
Mexican H on 103rd and Broadway During the early part
of the war imports of H were virtually cut off and the only
junk available was prescription M However lines of
communication reformed and heroin began coming in
from Mexico where there were poppy fields tended by
Chinese This Mexican H was brown in color since it had
quite a bit of raw opium in it
103rd and Broadway looks like any Broadway block
A cafeteria a movie stores In the middle of Broadway is
an island with some grass and benches placed at intervals
103rd is a subway stop a crowded block This is junk
territory Junk haunts the cafeteria roams up and down
the block sometimes halfcrossing Broadway to rest on
one of the island benches A ghost in daylight on a
crowded street
You could always find a few junkies sitting in the
cafeteria or standing around outside with coat collars
turned up spitting on the sidewalk and looking up and
down the street as they waited for the connection In summer
they sit on the island benches huddled like so many
vultures in their dark suits
The peddler had the face of a withered adolescent He
was fiftyfive but he did not look more than thirty He was
a small dark man with a thin Irish face When he did
show up  and like many oldtime junkies he was completely
unpunctual  he would sit at a table in the cafeteria
You gave him money at the table and met him around the
corner three minutes later where he would deliver the junk
He never had it on him but kept it stashed somewhere
close by
This man was known as Irish At one time he had
worked for Dutch Schultz but bigtime racketeers will not
keep junkies on the payroll as they are supposed to be
unreliable So Irish was out Now he peddled from time to
time and worked the hole rolling drunks on subways
and in cars when he couldnt make connections to peddle
One night Irish got nailed in the subway for jostling He
hanged himself in the Tombs
The job of peddler was a sort of public service that
rotated from one member of the group to the other the
average term of office being about three months All agreed
that it was a thankless job As George the Greek said
You end up broke and in jail Everybody calls you cheap
if you dont give credit; if you do they take advantage
George couldnt turn down a man who came to him
sick People took advantage of his kindness hitting him for
credit and taking their cash to some other pusher George
did three years and when he got out he refused to do any
more pushing
The hipsterbebop junkies never showed at 103rd
Street The 103rd Street boys were all oldtimers  thin sallow
faces; bitter twisted mouths; stifffingered stylized
gestures There is a junk gesture that marks the junky like
the limp wrist marks the fag the hand swings out from the
elbow stifffingered palm up They were of various nationalities
and physical types but they all looked alike
somehow They all looked like junk There was Irish
George the Greek Pantopon Rose Louie the Bellhop Eric
the Fag the Beagle the Sailor and Joe the Mex Several of
them are dead now others are doing time
There are no more junkies at 103rd and Broadway
waiting for the connection The connection has gone
somewhere else But the feel of junk is still there It hits
you at the corner follows you along the block then falls
away like a discouraged panhandler as you walk on
Joe the Mex had a thin face with a long sharp
twitchy nose and a downcurving toothless mouth Joes
face was lined and ravaged but not old Things had happened
to his face but Joe was not touched His eves were
bright and young There was a gentleness about him common
to many oldtime junkies You could spot Joe blocks
away In the anonymous city crowd he stood out sharp and
clear as though you were seeing him through binoculars
He was a liar and like most liars he was constantly changing
his stories altering time and personnel from one telling
to the next One time he would tell a story about some
friend next time he would switch the story around to give
himself the lead He would sit in the cafeteria over coffee
and pound cake talking at random about his experiences
We know this Chinaman has some stuff stashed and
we try every way to make him tell us Where it is We have
him tied to a chair I light matches  he made a gesture of
lighting a match  and put them under his feet He wont
say nothing I feel so sorry for that man Then my partner
hit him in the face with his gun and the blood run all down
his face He put his hands over his face and drew them
down to indicate the flow of blood When I see that I turn
sick at my stomach and I say `Lets get out of here and
leave the man alone He aint going to tell us nothing
Louie was a shoplifter who had lost what nerve he
ever had He wore long shabby black overcoats that gave
him all the look of a furtive buzzard Thief and junky
stuck out all over him Louie had a hard time making it I
heard that at one time he had been a stool pigeon but at
the time I knew him he was generally considered right
George the Greek did not like Louie and said he was just a
bum Dont ever invite him to your home hell take advantage
Hell go on the nod in front of your family Hes
got no class to him
George the Greek was the admitted arbiter of this set
He decided who was right and who was wrong George
prided himself on his integrity I never beat nobody
George was a threetime loser The next time meant
life as an habitual criminal His life narrowed down to the
necessity of avoiding any serious involvements No pushing
no stealing; he worked from time to time on the docks
He was hemmed in on every side and there was no way for
him to go but down When he couldnt get junk  which
was about half the time  he drank and took goof balls
He had two adolescent sons who gave him a lot of
trouble George was halfsick most of the time in this
period of scarcity and no match for these young louts His
face bore the marks of a constant losing fight The last
time I was in New York I couldnt find George The 103rd
Street boys are scattered now and no one I talked to knew
what happened to George the Greek
Fritz the Janitor was a pale thin little man who gave
the impression of being crippled He was on parole after
doing five years because he scored for a pigeon The
pigeon
was hard up for someone to turn in and the narcotics
agent urgently needed to make an arrest Between them
they built Fritz up to a bigtime dope peddler and smashed
a narcotics ring with his arrest Fritz was glad to attract so
much attention and he talked complacently about his
nickel in Lexington
The Fag was a brilliantly successful lushworker His
scores were fabulous He was the man who gets to a lush
first never the man who arrives on the scene when the lush
is lying there with his pockets turned inside out A sleeping
lush  known as a flop in the trade  attracts a hierarchy
of scavengers First come the top lushworkers like the
Fag guided by a special radar They only want cash good
rings and watches Then come the punks who will steal
anything They take the hat shoes and belt Finally
brazen clumsy thieves will try to pull the lushs overcoat
or jacket off him
The Fag was always first on a good lush One time he
scored for a thousand dollars at the 103rd Street Station
Often his scores ran into the hundreds If the lush woke
up he would simper and feel the mans thigh as though his
intentions were sexual From this angle he got this moniker
He always dressed well usually in tweed sport coats
and gray flannels A European charm of manner and a
slight Scandinavian accent completed his front No one
could have looked less like a lushroller He always worked
alone His luck was good and he was determined to avoid
contamination Sometimes contact with the lucky can
change a mans run of bad luck but generally it works out
the other way Junkies are an envious lot 103rd Street
envied the Fag his scores But everyone had to admit he
was a right guy and always good for a small touch
The H caps cost three dollars each and you need at
least three a day to get by I was short so I began
working the hole with Roy We would ride along each
looking out one side of the subway car until one of us
spotted a flop sleeping on a bench Then we would get
off the train I stood in front of the bench with a newspaper
and covered Roy while he went through the lushs
pockets Roy would whisper instructions to me  a little
left too far a little back there hold it there  and I
would move to keep him covered Often we were late and
the lush would be lying there with his pockets turned inside
out
We also worked on the cars I would sit down next to
the lush and open a newspaper Roy would reach across
my back and go through the lushs pockets If the lush
woke up he could see that I had both hands on the paper
We averaged about ten dollars a night
An average night went more or less like this We
started work about eleven oclock getting on the uptown
IRT at Times Square At 149th Street I spotted a flop and
we got off 149th Street is a station with several levels and
dangerous for lushworkers because there are so many
spots where cops can hide and it is not possible to cover
from every angle On the lower level the only way out is by
the elevator
We approached the flop casually as though we did
not see him He was middleaged sprawled against the
wall breathing loudly Roy sat down beside him and I
stationed myself in front of them with an open newspaper
Roy said A little to the right too far back a little there
thats good
Suddenly the heavy breathing stopped I thought of
the scene in the movies where the breathing stops during
the operation I could feel Roys immobility behind me
The drunk muttered something and shifted his position
Slowly the breathing started again Roy got up Okay he
said and walked rapidly to the other end of the platform
He took a crumpled mass of bills from his pocket and
counted out eight dollars He handed me four Had it in
his pants pocket I couldnt find a poke I thought for a
minute he was going to come up on us
We started back downtown At 116th we spotted one
and got off but the flop got up and walked away before we
could get near him A shabby man with a wide loose
mouth accosted Roy and started talking He was another
lushworker
The Fag scored again he said Two notes and a
wristwatch down at 96th Street Roy muttered something
and looked at his paper The man went on talking in a loud
voice I had one come up on me `What are you doing
with your hand in my pocket he says
For Chris sake dont talk like that Roy said and
walked away from him Fucking wrong bastard he muttered
There arent many lushworkers around now Only
the Fag the Beagle and that tramp They all envy the Fag
because he makes good scores If a sucker comes up on
him he pretends to feel his leg like he was a fag Those
tramps at 103rd Street go around saying `Goddam Fag
because they cant score Hes no more a fag than I am
Roy paused reflectively Not as much in fact
We rode to the end of the line in Brooklyn without
spotting a single flop On the way back there was a drunk
asleep in a car I sat down beside him and opened my
paper I could feel Roys arm across my back Once the
drunk woke up and looked at me sharply But both my
bands were clearly visible on the paper Roy pretended to
be reading the paper with me The drunk went back to
sleep
Heres where we get off Roy said We better go
out on the street for a bit Doesnt pay to ride too long
We had a cup of coffee at the 34th Street automat and
split the last take It was three dollars
When you take a lush on the car Roy was explainfag
you got to gauge yourself to the movement of the car
If you get the right rhythm you can work it out even if the
mooch is awake I went a little too fast on that one Thats
why he woke up He felt something was wrong but he
didnt know what it was
At Times Square we ran into Subway Mike He
nodded but did not stop Mike always worked alone
Lets take a run out to Queens Plaza Roy said
Thats on the Independent The Independent has special
cops hired by the company but they dont carry guns
Only saps So if one grabs you run if you can break
Queens Plaza is another dangerous station where it is
impossible to cover yourself from every angle You just
have to take a chance There was a drunk sleeping full
length on a bench but we couldnt risk taking him because
too many people were around
Well wait a bit Roy said Remember though
never pass more than three trains If you dont get a clear
chance by then forget it no matter how good it looks
Two young punks got off a train carrying a lush between
them They dropped him on a bench then looked at
Roy and me
Lets take him over to the other side said one of the
punks
Why not take him right here Roy asked
The punks pretended riot to understand Take him I
dont get it What does our queer friend mean They
picked up their lush and carried him to the other side of
the platform
Roy walked over to our mark and pulled a wallet out
of his pocket No time for finesse he remarked The
wallet was empty Roy dropped it on the bench
One of the punks shouted across the tracks Take
your hands out of his pockets And they both laughed
Fucking punks said Roy If I catch one of them
on the West Side line Ill push the little bastard onto the
tracks
One of the punks came over and asked Roy for a
cut
I tell you he didnt have nothing said Roy
We saw you take Out his wallet
There wasnt nothing in it
The train stopped and we got on leaving the punk
there undecided whether or not to get tough
Fucking punks think its a joke Roy said They
wont last long They wont think its so funny when they
get out on the Island doing fivetwentynine We were in a
run of bad luck Roy said Well thats the way it goes
Some nights you make a hundred dollars Some nights you
dont make anything
One night we got on the subway at Times Square A
flashily dressed man weaving slightly was walking ahead
of
us Roy looked him over and said Thats a good fucking
mooch Lets see where he goes
The mooch got on the IRT headed for Brooklyn We
waited standing up in the space between cars until the
mooch appeared to be sleeping Then we walked into the
car and I sat down beside the mooch opening The New
York Times The Times was Roys idea He said it made
me look like a businessman The car was almost empty
and there we were wedged up against the mooch with
twenty feet of empty seats available Roy began working
over my back The mooch kept stirring and once he woke
up and looked at me with bleary annoyance A Negro
sitting opposite us smiled
The shine is wise said Roy in my ear Hes OK
Roy was having trouble finding the poke The situation
was getting dangerous I could feel sweat running
down my arms
Lets get off I said
No This is a good mooch Hes sitting on his overcoat
and I cant get into his pocket When I tell you fall
up against him and Ill move the coat at the same time
Now    For Chris sake That wasnt near hard
enough
Lets get off I said again I could feel fear stirring
in my stomach Hes going to wake up
No Lets go again    Now    What in hell is
wrong with you Just let yourself flop against him hard
Roy I said For Chris sake lets get off Hes going
to wake up
I started to get up but Roy held me down Suddenly
he gave me a sharp push and I fell heavily against the
mooch
Got it that time Roy said
The poke
No I got the coat out of the way
We were out of the underground now and on the
elevated I was nauseated with fear every muscle rigid with
the effort of control The mooch was only half asleep I
expected him to jump up and yell at any minute
Finally I heard Roy say I got it
Lets go then
No what I got is a loose roll Hes got a poke somewhere
and Im going to find it Hes got to have a poke
Im getting off
No Wait I could feel him fumbling across my back
so openly that it seemed incredible that the man could go
on sleeping
It was the end of the line Roy stood up Cover me
he said I stood in front of him with the paper shielding
him as much as possible from the other passengers There
were only three left but they were in different ends of the
car Roy went through the mans pockets openly and
crudely Lets go outside he said We went out on the
platform
The mooch woke up and put his hand in his pocket
Then he came out on the platform and walked up to Roy
All right Jack he said Give me my money
Roy shrugged and turned his hands out palm up
What money What are you talking about
You know Goddamned well what Im talking about
You had your hand in my pocket
Roy held his hands out again in a gesture of puzzlement
and deprecation Aw what are you talking about I
dont know anything about your money
Ive seen you on this line every night This is your
regular route He turned and pointed to me And theres
your partner right there Now are you going to give me
my dough
What dough
Okay Just stay put Were taking a ride back to town
and this had better be good Suddenly the man put both
hands in Roys coat pockets You sonofabitch he veiled
Give me my dough
Roy hit him in the face and knocked him down
Why you   said Roy dropping abruptly his conciliatory
and puzzled manner Keep your hands off me
The conductor seeing a fight in progress was holding
up the train so that no one would fall on the tracks
Lets cut I said We started down the platform The
man got up and ran after us He threw his arms around
Roy holding on stubbornly Roy couldnt break loose He
was pretty well winded
Get this mooch off me Roy yelled
I hit the man twice in the face His grip loosened and
he fell to his knees
Kick his head off said Roy
I kicked the man in the side and felt a rib snap The
man put his hand to his side Help he shouted He did
not try to get up
Lets cut I said At the far end of the platform I
heard a police whistle The man was still lying there on the
platform holding his side and yelling Help at regular
intervals
There was a slight drizzle of rain falling When I hit
the street I slipped and skidded on the wet sidewalk We
were standing by a closed filling station looking back at
the elevated
Lets go I said
Theyll see us
We cant stay here
We started to walk I noticed that my mouth was bone
dry Roy took two goof balls from his shirt pocket
Mouths too dry he said I cant swallow them
We went on walking
Theres sure to be an alarm out for us Roy said
Keep a lookout for cars Well duck in the bushes if any
come along Theyll be figuring us to get back on the
subway so the best thing we can do is keep walking
The drizzle continued Dogs barked at us as we
walked
Remember our story if we get nailed Roy said We
fell asleep and woke up at the end of the line This guy
accused us of taking his money We were scared so we
knocked him down and ran Theyll beat the shit out of
us You have to expect that
Here comes a car I said Yellow lights too
We crawled into the bushes at the side of the road and
crouched down behind a signboard The car drove slowly
by We started walking again I was getting sick and wondered
if I would get home to the M S I had stashed in my
apartment
When we get closer in we better split up Roy said
Out here we might be able to do each other some good If
we run into a cop on the beat well tell him weve been
with some girls and were looking for the subway This rain
is a break The cops will all be in some allnight joint
drinking coffee For Chris sake he said irritably Dont
round like that
I had turned around and looked over my shoulder
Its natural to turn around I said
Natural for thieves
We finally ran into the BMT line and rode back to
Manhattan
Roy said I dont think Im just speaking for myself
when I say I was scared Oh Heres your cut
He handed me three dollars
Next day I told him I was through as a lushworker
I dont blame you he said But you got a wrong
impression Youre bound to get some good breaks if you
stick around long enough
My case came to trial in Special Sessions I drew a
fourmonth suspended sentence After I gave up lushworking
I decided to push junk There isnt much money in it
About all a streetpeddler addict can expect to do is keep
up His habit But at least when you are pushing you have a
good supply of junk on hand and that gives a feeling of
security Of course some people do make money pushing
I knew an Irish pusher who started out capping a 116
ounce envelope of H and two years later when he took a
fall and went away for three years he had thirty thousand
dollars and an apartment building in Brooklyn
If you want to push the first step is to find a wholesale
connection I did not have a connection so I formed a
partnership with Bill Gains who had a pretty fair Italian
connection on the lower East Side We bought the stuff for
ninety dollars per quarterounce cut it onethird with milk
sugar and put it in onegrain caps The caps sold for two
dollars each retail They ran about ten to sixteen percent
H which is very high for retail capped stuff There should
be at least a hundred caps in onequarter ounce of H
before it is cut But if the wholesaler is Italian he is almost
sure to give a short count We usually got about eighty
caps out of these Italian quarterounces
Bill Gains came from a good family  as I recall
his father had been a bank president somewhere in
Maryland  and he had front Gains routine was stealing
overcoats out of restaurants and he was perfectly adapted
to this work The American uppermiddleclass citizen is a
composite of negatives He is largely delineated by what he
is not Gains went further He was not merely negative He
was positively invisible; a vague respectable presence
There is a certain kind of ghost that can only materialize
with the aid of a sheet or other piece of cloth to give it
outline Gains was like that He materialized in someone
elses overcoat
Gains had a malicious childlike smile that formed a
shocking contrast to his eyes which were pale blue lifeless
and old He smiled listening down into himself as if attending
to something there that pleased him Sometimes
after a shot he would smile and listen and say slyly This
stuff is powerful With the same smile he would report on
the deterioration and misfortunes of others Herman was
a beautiful kid when he first came to New York The
trouble is he lost his looks
Gains was one of the few junkies who really took a
special pleasure in seeing nonusers get a habit Many
junkypushers are glad to see a new addict for economic
reasons If you have a commodity you naturally want customers
provided they are the right kind But Gains liked to
invite young kids up to his room and give them a shot
usually compounded of old cottons and then watch the
effects smiling his little smile
Mostly the kids said it was a good kick and that was
all Just another kick like nembies or bennies or lush or
weed But a few stayed around to get hooked and Gains
would look at these converts and smile a prelate of junk
A little later you would hear him say Really soandso
must realize that I cant carry him any longer The pledge
was no longer being rushed It was time for him to pay off
And pay off for the rest of his life waiting on street corners
and in cafeterias for the connection the mediator
between man and junk Gains was a mere parish priest in
the hierarchy of junk He would speak of the higherups in
a voice of sepulchral awe The connections say
His veins were mostly gone retreated back to the
bone to escape the probing needle For a while he used
arteries which are deeper than veins and harder to hit and
for this procedure he bought special long needles He rotated
from his arms and hands to the veins of his feet A
vein will come back in time Even so he had to shoot in
the skin about half the time But he only gave up and
skinned a shot after an agonizing halfhour of probing
and poking and cleaning out the needle which would clot
up with blood
One of my first customers was a Village character
named Nick Nick painted when he did anything His canvases
were very small and looked as if they had been
concentrated compressed misshapen by a tremendous
pressure The product of a depraved mind a narcotics
agent pronounced solemnly after viewing one of Nicks
pictures
Nick was always half sick his large plaintive brown
eyes watering slightly and his thin nose running He slept
on couches in the apartments of friends existing on the
precarious indulgence of neurotic unstable stupidly suspicious
individuals who would suddenly throw him out
without reason or warning For these people he also
scored hoping that he would receive in return at least the
bead off a cap to take the edge off his constant junkhunger
Often he got nothing but a casual thanks the purchaser
having convinced himself that Nick had somehow got his
on the other end As a result Nick began stealing a small
amount from each cap loosening up the junk so that it
filled the cap
There was not much left of Nick His constant unsatisfied
hunger had burned out all other concerns He talked
vaguely about going to Lexington for the cure or shipping
out in the merchant marine or buying paregoric in Connecticut
and tapering off on it
Nick introduced me to Tony who tended bar in a
Village bar and restaurant Tony had been pushing and
nearly got nailed when the Federals rushed into his apartment
He barely had time to throw a 116ounce packet of
H under the piano The Federals found nothing but his
works and they let him go Tony was scared and quit
pushing He was a young Italian who obviously knew his
way around He looked capable of keeping his mouth shut
A good type Customer
I went to Tonys bar every day and ordered a Coca
Cola Tony would tell me how many caps he wanted and I
would go into the phone booth or the WC and wrap his
caps up in silver paper When I got back to my Coke the
money for the caps was there on the bar like change I
dropped the caps into an ashtray on the bar and Tony
emptied the ashtray under the bar taking out his caps
This routine was necessary because the owner knew Tony
had been a user and had told him to stay off the stuff or get
another job In fact the Owners son was a user  at this
time in a sanitarium taking the cure When he got out he
came straight to rue to buy stuff He said he couldnt stay
off
A young Italian hipster named Ray used to come to
this bar every day He seemed OK so I took care of him
too dropping his caps in the ashtray with Tonys This bar
where Tony worked was a small place down several steps
from street level There was only one door I always felt
trapped when I went in there The place gave me such a
feeling of depression and danger that I could hardly bring
myself to go through the door
After taking care of Tony and Ray I generally met
Nick in a cafeteria on Sixth Avenue He always had the
price of a few caps on him I knew of course that he was
Scoring for other people but I did not know who they
were I should have known better than to have dealings
with anybody like Nick who was sick and broke all the
time and therefore liable to pick up anybodys money
Some people need an intermediary to score for them because
they are strangers in town or because they have not
been on junk long enough to get acquainted But the
pusher has reason to be wary of people who send someone
else to score By and large the reason a man cant score is
because he is known to be wrong So he sends someone
else to score who may not be wrong himself but simply
desperate for junk To score for a stool pigeon is definitely
not ethical Often a man goes on from scoring for pigeons
to become a pigeon himself
I was not in a position to turn money down I had no
margin Every day I had to sell enough caps to buy the
next 14ounce and I was never more than a few dollars
ahead So I took whatever money Nick had and asked no
questions
I went into pushing with Bill Gains who handled the
uptown business I met Bill in an Eighth Avenue cafeteria
after I finished up in the Village He had a few good
customers Izzy probably his best had a job as cook on a
tugboat in New York harbor He was one of the 103rd
Street boys Izzy had done time for pushing was known as
a thoroughly right guy and he had a steady source of
income This is a perfect customer
Sometimes Izzy showed up with his partner Goldie
who worked on the same boat Goldie was a thin hooknosed
man with the skin drawn tight over his face and a
spot of color on each cheekbone Another of Izzys friends
was a young exparatrooper named Matty a husky handsome
hardfaced young man who bore none of the marks
of a drug addict There were also two whores that Bill took
care of Generally whores are not a good deal They attract
heat and most of them will talk But Bill insisted that
these particular whores were OK
Another of our customers was Old Bart He took a
few caps every day which he sold on commission I didnt
know his customers but I didnt worry about it Bart was
OK If there was a beef he would take the rap without
talking Anyway he had thirty years experience in junk
and he knew what he was doing
When I arrived at the cafeteria where we had our
meet there was Bill sitting at a table his skinny frame
huddled in someone elses overcoat Old Bait shabby and
inconspicuous was dunking a doughnut in his coffee Bill
told me he had already taken care of Izzy so I gave Bart
ten caps to sell and Bill and I took a cab to my apartment
There we had a shot and checked over the stock setting
aside ninety dollars for the next 14 ounce
After Bill got his shot a little color crept into his face
and he would become almost coy It was a gruesome sight
I remember once he told me how hed been propositioned
by a queer who offered him twenty dollars Bill declined
saying I dont think you would be very well satisfied
Bill twitched his fleshless hips You should see me in the
nude he said Im really cute
One of Bills most distasteful conversation routines
consisted of detailed bulletins on the state of his bowels
Sometimes it gets so I have to reach my fingers in and pull
it out Hard as porcelain you understand The pain is
terrible
Listen I said this connection keeps giving us a
short count I only got eighty caps out of the last batch
after it was cut
Well you cant expect too much If I could go to a
hospital and get a good enema But they wont do a thing
for you unless you check into the hospital and of course I
cant do that They keep you at least twentyfour hours I
told them `Youre supposed to be a hospital Im in pain
and I need treatment Why cant you just call an attendant
and
There was no stopping him When people start talking
about their bowel movements they are as inexorable as the
processes of which they speak
Things went on like this for several weeks One by
one Nicks contacts located me They were tired of scoring
through Nick and having him steal the head off their caps
What a crew Mooches fags fourflushers stool pigeons
bums  unwilling to work unable to steal always short of
money always whining for credit In the whole lot there
was not one who wouldnt wilt and spill as soon as someone
belted him in the mouth and said Where did you get
it
The worst of the lot was Gene Doolie a scrawny little
Irishman with a manner between fag and pimp Gene was
informer to the bone He probably pulled out dirty lists of
people  his hands were always dirty  and read them off
to
the law You could see him bustling into Black and Tan
headquarters during the Irish Trouble in a dirty gray toga
turning in Christians giving information to the Gestapo
the GPU sitting in a cafeteria talking to a narcotics agent
Always the same thin ratty face shabby outofdate
clothes whiny penetrating voice
The most unbearable thing about Gene was his voice
It went all through you This voice was my first knowledge
of his existence Nick had just arrived at my apartment
with some score money when I was called to the hall
phone by the buzzer
Im Gene Doolie said the voice Im waiting for
Nick and Ive been waiting a long time His voice went
up on long time to a shrill grating whine
I said Well hes here now I expect you will see him
directly and I hung up
Next day Doolie called me again Im just around
the corner from your place Do you mind if I come on
over Its cooler for me to meet you alone
He hung up before I could say anything and ten
minutes later he was standing in the door
When one personality meets another for the first time
there is a period of mutual examination on the intuitive
level of empathy and identification But it was impossible
to relate ones self to Doolie in any way He was simply the
focal point for a hostile intrusive force You could feel him
walk right into your psyche and look around to see if
anything was there he could make use of I stepped back a
little from the door to avoid contact with him He squeezed
himself into the room and immediately sat down on the
couch and lit a cigarette
Its better to meet alone like this His smile was
ambiguously sexual Nick is a very uncool guy He
stood up and handed me four dollars Do you mind if I
take off here he asked pulling off his coat
I had never heard anyone else use this expression For
an insane moment I thought he was making advances He
dropped his coat on the couch and rolled up his sleeve I
brought him two caps and a glass of water He had his own
works for which I was grateful I watched him as he hit a
vein pressed the dropper and rolled down his sleeve
When you are hooked the effects of a shot are not
dramatic But the observer who knows what to look for
can see the immediate working of junk in the blood and
cells of another user But in Doolie I could detect no
change whatever He put on his coat and picked up the
cigarette which had been smoldering in an ashtray He
looked at me with his pale blue eyes that seemed to have
no depth at all They looked artificial
Let me tell you something he said Youre making
a big mistake to trust Nick A few nights ago I was in
Thompsons Cafeteria and I ran into Rogers the agent He
told me `I know Nick is scoring for all you Goddamned
junkies here in the Village Youre getting good stuff too
between sixteen and twenty percent Well you can tell
Nick this We can take him any time we want and when
we do catch up to him hes going to work with us He
opened up for me once Hell do it again Were going to
fnd out where this stuff is coming from
Doolie looked at me and sucked on his cigarette
When they get Nick theyll get you Youd better let Nick
know that if he talks youll have him poured into a barrel
of concrete and dumped in the East River I dont need to
tell you any more You can see what the situation is
He looked at me trying to gauge the effect of his
words It was impossible to tell just how much of this story
I was expected to believe Perhaps it was just a roundabout
way of saying How will you ever know who fingered
you With Nick such an obvious suspect if I talked you
could never be sure could you now
Could you let me have one cap on credithe asked
What Ive just told you should be worth something
I gave him a cap and he pocketed it without comment
He stood up Well Ill be seeing you Ill call at this
same time tomorrow
I put out a grapevine to see what I could find out
about Doolie and to check his story No one knew anything
definite about him Tony the bartender said Doolie
will fink if he has to But he couldnt give me a definite
instance Yes Nick was known to have talked once But
the facts of this case in which Doolie was also involved
indicated the tip could just as well have come from Doolie
Several days after the Gene Doolie episode I was
coming out of the subway at Washington Square when a
thin blond kid walked up to me Bill he said I guess
you dont know who I am Ive been scoring off you
through Nick and Im tired of having him steal the head off
all my caps Cant you take care of me directly
I thought What the hell After Gene Doolie why get
particular OK kid I said How many do you want
He gave me four dollars
Lets take a walk I said and started toward Sixth
Avenue I had two caps in my hand and waited for one of
the empty spaces you hit in a city Get ready to cop I
said and dropped the caps into his hands I made a meet
with him for the next day in the Washington Square Bickfords
This blond kids name was Chris I heard from Nick
that his folks had money and that he lived on an allowance
from home When I met him the next day in Bickfords he
immediately began to give me the letmewarnyouabout
Nick routine Nick is followed all the time now You
know yourself when a guy is yenning he doesnt look
behind him Hes running So you see who you picked out
to give your address and phone number to
I know all about that I said
Chris pretended to be hurt Well I hope you know
what youre doing Now listen this is not a routine Im
positively getting a check from my aunt this afternoon
Look at this
He pulled a telegram horn his pocket I glanced at it
There was some vague reference to a check He went on
explaining about the check As he talked he kept putting
his hand on my arm and gazing earnestly into my face I
felt I could not stand any more of this sweet con To Cut
him short I handed him one cap before he could put it on
me for two or three
Next day he showed up with a dollareighty He didnt
say anything about the check And so it went He came up
short or not at all He was always about to get money
from his aunt or motherinlaw or somebody These stories
he documented with letters and telegrams He got to be
almost as much of a drag as Gene Doolie
Another prize customer was Marvin parttime waiter
in a Village nightclub He was always unshaved and dirtylooking
He had only one shirt which he washed every
week or so and dried out on the radiator The final touch
was that he wore no socks I used to deliver stuff to his
room a dirty furnished room in a red brick house on Jane
Street I figured it was better to deliver to his place than to
meet him anywhere else
Some people are allergic to junk One time I delivered
a cap to Marvin and he took a shot I was looking out the
window  it is nerveracking to watch someone probe for a
vein  and when I turned around I noticed his dropper was
full of blood He had passed out and the blood had run
back into the dropper I called to Nick and he pulled the
needle out and slapped Marvin with a wet towel He came
around partly and muttered something
I guess hes OK I said Lets cut
He looked like a corpse slumped there on the dirty
unmade bed his limp arm stretched out a drop of blood
slowly gathering at the elbow
As we walked downstairs Nick told me that Marvin
had been after him for my address
Listen I said if you give it to him you can find
yourself a new connection One thing I dont need is somebody
dying in my apartment
Nick looked hurt Of course I wont give him your
address
What about Doolie
I dont know how he got the address I swear I
dont
Along with these bums I picked up a couple of good
customers One day I ran into Bert a character I knew
from the Angle Bar Bert was known as a muscle man He
was a heavyset roundfaced deceptively softlooking
young man who specialized in strongarm routines and
shakes I never knew him to use anything but weed and
I was surprised when he asked me if I was holding any
junk I told him yes I was pushing junk and he bought
ten caps I found out he had been hooked for about six
months
Through Bert I met another customer This was
Louis a very handsome type with a waxy complexion
delicate features and a silky black mustache He looked
like an 1890 portrait Louis was a pretty fair thief and was
generally wellheeled When he asked for credit which
was seldom he always made good the next day Sometimes
he brought around a watch or a suit instead of cash
which was all right with me I picked up a fiftydollar
watch from him for five caps
Pushing junk is a constant strain on the nerves
Sooner or later you get the copper jitters and everybody
looks like a cop People moving about in the subway seem
to be edging closer so they can grab you before you have a
chance to throw away the junk
Doolie came around every day impudent demanding
insufferable Usually he had some new bulletin on the Nick
Rogers situation He didnt mind letting me know that he
was in constant touch with Rogers
Rogers is shrewd but hes corny Doolie told me
He keeps saying `I dont care about you damned junkies
Im after the guys who make money out of it When we
find Nick hes going to fink He opened up for me once
Hell do it again
Chris kept hounding me for credit whining and pawing
at me and talking about the money he was going to
have for sure in a few days or a few hours
Nick looked harried and desperate I guess he didnt
waste any money on food He looked like the terminal
stages of some wasting disease
When I delivered to Marvin I left before he took his
shot I knew he would die from junk sooner or later and I
didnt want to be around when it happened
On top of all this I was just barely scraping by The
short counts we kept getting from the wholesaler the constant
nibbles of credit and customers coming up twentyfive
fifty or even a dollar short plus my own habit cut
profits to bare subsistence
When I complained about the wholesaler Bill Gains
got snappish and said I ought to cut the stuff more
Youre giving a better cap than anybody in New York
City Nobody sells sixteen percent stuff on the street If
your customers dont like it they can take their business to
Walgreens
We kept moving our uptown meets from one cafeteria
to another It doesnt take the manager long to spot a
bookie or a junk pusher There were about six regular
uptown customers now and that means quite a bit of
traffic So we kept moving
Tonys bar still gave me the horrors One day it was
raining very hard and I was on my way to Tonys about a
half hour late Ray the young Italian hipster stuck his
head out of the door of a restaurant and called me over It
was a lunch counter with booths along one wall We sat
down at a booth and I ordered tea
Theres an agent outside in a white trenchcoat Ray
told me He followed me over here from Tonys and Im
afraid to go out
The table was made of tube metal and Ray showed
me guiding my hand under the table where there was an
open end to one of the tubes I sold him two caps He
wrapped them in a paper napkin and stuffed the napkin
into the tube
Im going out clean first in case I get a shake he
said
I drank my cup of tea thanked him for the information
and left ahead of him I had the stuff in a package of
cigarettes and was ready to throw it in the waterfilled
gutter Sure enough there was a burly young man in a
white trenchcoat standing in a doorway When he saw me
he started sauntering up the street ahead of me Then he
turned a corner waiting for me to walk past so he could
fall in behind I turned and ran back in the opposite direction
When I reached Sixth Avenue he was about fifty feet
behind me I vaulted the subway turnstile and shoved the
cigarette package into the space at the side of a gum machine
I ran down one level and got a train up to the
Square
Bill Gains was sitting at a table in the cafeteria He
was wearing one stolen overcoat and another lay on his
lap He looked sly and satisfied Old Bart was there and an
unemployed cab driver named Kelly who hung around
42nd Street and sometimes picked up a few dollars peddling
condoms and with a routine of hitting commuters for
fifty cents which is one variety of the short con I told
them about the agent and Old Bait went down to pick up
the stuff
Gains looked annoyed and said pettishly For Gods
sake watch whose money you pick up
If I hadnt picked up Rays money Id be on my way
to the Federal building
Well be careful
We waited around for Bait and Kelly began telling a
long story about how he told off a guard in the Tombs
Bait was back soon with the stuff He reported that a
guy with a white trenchcoat was still walking around on
the station platform I gave Bait two caps under the table
Gains and I walked over to his room to take a shot
Really he said Im going to have to tell Bait I cant
carry him any longer Gains lived in a cheap rooming
house in the West Forties He opened the door to his room
You wait here he said Im going to get my works
Like most junkies he kept his works and caps stashed
somewhere outside his room He came back with the works
and we both took a shot
Gains was aware of his talent for invisibility and at
times he felt the need for holding himself together so he
would at least have enough flesh to put a needle in At
these times he would assemble all his claims to reality
Now he began rummaging around in the bureau and
brought out a worn manila envelope He showed me a
discharge from Annapolis for the good of the service an
old dirty letter from my friend the captain a card to
the Masons and a card to the Knights of Columbus
Every little bit helps he said indicating these
credentials He sat for a few minutes silent and reflective
Then he smiled Just a victim of circumstances he said
He stood up and carefully put away his envelope Ive
about burned down all the pawnshops in New York You
dont mind pawning these coats for me do you
After that things got worse and worse One day the
hotel clerk stopped me in the lobby I dont know how to
say this he said but theres something wrong about the
people who come up to your room I used to be in illegitimate
business myself years ago I just wanted to warn you
to be careful You know all calls come through the office
I heard one this morning and it was pretty obvious If
someone else had been at the switchboard    So be
careful and tell these people to watch what they say over
the phone
The call he referred to was Doolies That morning he
had called me up I want to see you he yelled Im sick
Ill be over right away
I could feel the Federals moving steadily closer It was
a question of time I did not trust any of the Village customers
and I was convinced that at least one of them was
a rank stool pigeon Doolie was my number one suspect
with Nick running a very close second and Chris trailing
in third place Of course there was always the possibility
that Marvin might take the easy way of raising money to
buy a pair of socks
Nick also scored for some respectable working people
in the Village who indulged in an occasional joy bang
This type person is a bad security risk because of timidity
They are afraid of the police they are afraid of losing their
responsible jobs It does not occur to them that there is
anything wrong about giving information to the law Of
course they will not come forward with information because
of their fear of being involved But they will generally
spill under police questioning
Narcotics agents operate largely with the aid of informers
The usual routine is to grab someone with junk
on him and let him stew in jail until he is good and sick
Then comes the spiel
We can get you five years for possession On the
other hand you can walk out of here right new The
decision is up to you If you work with us we can give you
a good deal For one thing youll have plenty of junk and
pocket money That is if you deliver Take a few minutes
to think it over
The agent takes out a few caps and puts them on the
table This is like pouring a glass of ice water in front of a
man dying of thirst Why dont you pick them up Now
youre being sensible The first man we want to get is
Some of them dont need to be pressured Junk and
pocket money is all they want and they dont care how
they get it The new pigeon is given marked money and
sent out to make a buy When the pigeon makes a buy with
this money the agents close in right away to make the
arrest It is essential to make the arrest before the peddler
has a chance to change the marked money The agents
have the marked money that bought the junk and the junk
it bought If the case is important enough the pigeon may
be called upon to testify Of course once he appears in
court and testifies the pigeon is known to the trade and no
one will serve him Unless the agents want to send him to
another town some especially able pigeons go on tour
his informing career is finished
Sooner or later the peddlers get wise to a pigeon and
the pigeon cant score When this happens his usefulness
to the agents is at an end and they usually turn him in
Often he ends up doing more time than anybody he sent
up
In the case of young kids who would be no use as fulltime
pigeons the procedure is different The agent may
come on with the old cop con I hate to send a young kid
like you away Sure you made a mistake That can happen
to anybody Now listen Im going to give you a break but
youll have to cooperate with us Otherwise I wont be able
to help you Or else they just belt him in the mouth and
say Where did you get it With lots of people thats all
it takes You could find an example of every type informer
overt or potential among my customers
After the hotel clerk spoke to me I moved to another
hotel and registered under another name I stopped going
to the Village and shifted all the Village customers to uptown
meets
When I told Gains what the hotel clerk said to me and
how lucky we were he happened to be a right guy he said
Weve got to pack in We cant last with this crowd
Well I said theyre up there now waiting for us in
front of the automat The whole lot of them Shall we go
today
Yes Im going to Lexington for the cure and I need
bus fare Im leaving tonight
As soon as we got in sight of the meet Doolie broke
from the others and ran up to us at full speed pulling off a
twotone sports jacket He was wearing some sort of sandals
or slippers
Give me four caps for this coat he said Ive been
in the can twentyfour hours
Doolie sick was an unnerving sight The envelope of
personality was gone dissolved by his junkhungry cells
Viscera and cells galvanized into a loathsome insectlike
activity seemed on the point of breaking through the surface
His face was blurred unrecognizable at the same
time shrunken and tumescent
Gains gave Doolie two caps and took the coat
Ill give you two more tonight he said Right here
at nine oclock
Izzy whod been standing by silent had been looking
at Doolie with disgust Holy Jesus he said Sandals
The others swarmed around holding out their hands
like a crowd of Asiatic beggars None of them had any
money
I said No credit and we started walking down the
street They followed us whining and clutching at our
sleeves Just one cap
I said no and kept on walking One after the other
they fell away We walked down into the subway and told
Izzy we were packing in
Jeez he said I dont blame you Sandals
Izzy bought six caps and we gave two caps to Old
Dart who was going out to Rikers for the thirtyday cure
Bill Gains was examining the sports coat with a practiced
eye It should bring ten dollars easy he said I
know a tailor who will sew up this rip for me One pocket
Was slightly torn Where did he get it
He claims from Brooks Brothers But hes the kind
of guy who would say anything he stole came from Brooks
Brothers or Abercrombie & Fitch
Its too bad said Gains smiling My bus leaves at
six I wont be able to give him the other two caps I
promised
Dont worry about it Hes into us for a double
sawski
He is Well then it doesnt make any difference
Bill Gains left for Lexington and I started for Texas
in my car I had 116ounce of junk with me I figured this
was enough to taper off and I had a reduction schedule
carefully worked out It was supposed to take twelve days
1 had the junk in solution and in another bottle distilled
water Every time I took a dropper of solution out to use
It I put the same amount of distilled water in the junk
solution bottle Eventually I would be shooting plain water
This method is well known to all junkies A variation of it
is known as the Chinese cure which is carried out with
hop and Wampoles Tonic After a few weeks you find
yourself drinking plain Wampoles Tonic
Four days later in Cincinnati I was out of junk and
immobilized I have never known one of these selfadministered
reduction cures to work You find reasons to make
each shot an exception that calls for a little extra junk
Finally the junk is all gone and you still have your habit
I left the car in storage and took a train to Lexington
I did not have the papers that are required for admittance
but I was relying on my Army discharge to get me in
When I got to Lexington I took a taxi out to the hospital
several miles from the town We reached the gatehouse of
the hospital In the gatehouse was an old Irish guard He
looked at my Army discharge
Are you addicted to the use of habitforming drugs
I said yes
Well sit down He pointed to a bench
He called the main building No no papers    Got
an Army discharge He looked over from the phone
You ever been here before he asked
I said no
Says he hasnt been here before The guard hung
up A car will be down for you in a few minutes he told
me Have you got any drugs or needles or droppers on
your person You can surrender them here but if you take
them up to the main building you are liable to prosecution
for introducing contraband articles into a Government
reservation
Ive got nothing
After a short wait a car came down to the gate and
drove me up to the main building A heavy barred iron
door opened automatically to let the car in then closed
after it A polite guard took my addiction history
Youre doing a sensible thing to come here he told
me Theres one man in here now whos spent every
Christmas for the past twentyfive years locked up somewhere
I checked my clothes into a basket and took a shower
The next step was a physical examination I had to wait
about fifteen minutes for the doctor The doctor apologized
for keeping me waiting gave me a physical examination
and took my addiction history His manner was courteous
and efficient He listened to my addiction history interrupting
with an occasional comment or question When I mentioned
buying junk by the 14ounce he smiled and said
Selling some of it to keep up the habit eh
Finally he leaned back in his chair As you know
he said you can leave here on twentyfour hours notice
Some people leave after ten days and stay off permanently
Some stay six months and go back two days after they get
out But statistically speaking the longer you stay the
better chance you have of staying off The procedure here
is more or less impersonal The cure lasts about eight or
ten days depending on severity of addiction You can put
on that dressing gown now
He pointed to pajamas and dressing gown and slippers
that were laid out for me The doctor was speaking rapidly
into a dictaphone He gave a brief account of my physical
condition and addiction history Patient seems secure and
states his reason for seeking cure is necessity of providing
for his family
A guard took me to my ward
If you want to get off drugs he said this is the
place to do it
The ward attendant asked me if I really wanted to get
off drugs I said yes He assigned me to a private room
About fifteen minutes later the attendant called Shot
line Everyone in the ward lined up As our names were
called we put an arm through a window in the door of the
ward dispensary and the attendant gave the shots Sick as I
was the shot fixed me Right away I began to get hungry
I walked up to the middle of the ward where there
were benches chairs and a radio and got in conversation
with a thuggishlooking young Italian He asked me if I
had much of a record I said no
You ought to be up with the DoRights he said
You get a longer cure there and better rooms
The DoRights were people in Lexington for the first
time who were considered to be especially good prospects
for a permanent cure Evidently the doctor in Reception
didnt think too much of my prospects
Others drifted out and joined the conversation The
shot had made them feel sociable First came a Negro from
Ohio
How much time you bringing with you the Italian
asked him
Three years the Negro said He was in for forging
and selling scripts He began telling about a stretch he did
in Ohio State Thats a fuck of a place to do time A
bunch of kids in there rough little bastards You get your
stuff at the commissary and some punk comes up to you
and says `Give it to me If you dont give it to him he
belts you one in the kisser Then they all gang up on you
You aint going to whip all of them
A gamblinghouse dealer from East St Louis was describing
a method for cooking the carbolic acid out of a
phenol sweet oil and tincture of opium script
I tell the croaker Ive got an aged mother and she
uses this prescription for piles After you get the sweet oil
drained off you put the stuff in a tablespoon and hold it
over a gas flame That burns the phenol right out Itll hold
you twentyfour hours
A handsome powerfully built man of forty or so
with a tan complexion and irongray hair was telling how
his girl smuggled stuff to him in an orange So there we
were in County Goddamn both of us shitting in our pants
like a goose Hell when I bit into that orange it was so
bitter Must have been fifteen or twenty grains in it shot in
with a hypo I didnt know she had that much sense
The guard says to me `Drug addict Why you sonofabitch
you mean youre a dope fiend Well youll get no
medicine in here
Sweet oil and tincture The oil floats to the top and
you can draw it off with a dropper Cooks up black as
tar
So I hit Philly sick as a sonofabitch
Well the croaker says `Okay how much do you
use
Ever use powdered Dilaudid Lots of guys killed
themselves with it About as much as you can put on the
end of a toothpick The big end that is no more
Cook it up and shoot it
On the nod
Loaded
That was back in `33 Twentyeight dollars an
ounce
We used to make a pipe out of a bottle and a rubber
tube When we got through smoking wed break the bottie
Cook it up and shoot it
On the nod
Sure you can shoot cocaine in the skin It hits you
right in the stomach
H and coke You can smell it going in
Like hungry men who can talk about nothing but
food After a while the shot began to wear off Conversation
slackened People drifted off to lie down read or play
cards Lunch was served in the ward room and was an
excellent meal
There were three shots a day One at seven am when
we got up one at one pm and one at nine pm Two old
acquaintances had come in during the afternoon Matty
and Louis I ran into Louis as we were lining up for the
evening shot
Did they get you he asked me
No Just here for the cure How about you
Same with me he answered
With the evening shot they gave me some chloral
hydrate in a glass Five new arrivals were brought to the
ward during the night The ward attendant threw up his
hands I dont know where Im going to put them Ive got
thirtyone dope fiends in here now
Among the new arrivals was a dignified whitehaired
man of seventy named Bob Riordan an oldtime con man
junk pusher and pickpocket He looked the way bankers
looked around 1910 He had come with two friends in a
car On the way to Lexington they had called the Surgeon
General in Washington and asked him to wire ahead to the
gate that they were coming and should be let right in They
referred to the Surgeon General as Felix and seemed to
know him from way back But only Riordan got in that
night The other two drove to a town near Lexington
where they knew a croaker to get fixed before they were
immobilized for lack of junk
They both came in about noon the next day Sal
Bloom was a fat man with a heavy Jewish face Con man
stuck out all over him With him was a little thin man
called Bunky Bunky might have been an old farmer or any
driedup skinny old man except for his gray eyes serene
and cold behind steelrimmed spectacles These were
Riordans two friends All of them had done a lot of time
mostly Federal time for pushing junk They were affable
but maintained a certain reserve The story they put down
was that they really wanted to get off junk because the
Federals bothered them all the time
As Sal said Hell I love junk and I can get a room
full of it But if I cant use without I get static all the time
from the law Ill get off junk and stay off He went on
talking about some old acquaintances who got their start in
junk and later turned respectable Now they say `Dont
have anything to do with Sal Hes a shmecker
I dont think they expected anyone to believe the
gettingoffjunk routine It was just a way of saying Why
we came here is our own business
Another new arrival was Abe Green a longnosed
Jew with one leg He was almost a ringer for Jimmy
Durante He had pale blue birdlike eyes Even junksick
he radiated a fierce vitality His first night in the ward he
was so sick a doctor came down to examine him and gave
him an extra %grain of morphine In a few days he was
stumping around the ward talking and playing cards
Green was a wellknown pusher from Brooklyn one of the
few independent operators in the business Most pushers
have to work for the syndicate or quit but Green had so
many connections he could stay in business on his own At
the time he was out on bail but expected to beat the rap
on the grounds of illegal seizure He the agent wakes
me up in the middle of the night and starts beating me over
the head with his gun Wants me to give him my connection
I told him `Im fiftyfour years old and Ive never
given you guys anything yet Ill be dead first
Telling about a stretch in Atlanta where he kicked a
habit cold Fourteen days I was beating my head against
the wall and blood came out of my eyes and nose When
the screw came Id spit in his face Coming from him
these narratives had an epic quality
Benny was another oldtime Jewish shmecker from
New York He had been in Lexington eleven times and was
in on the Blue Grass this trip According to the Blue Grass
Law of Kentucky any known user of narcotic drugs can
be sentenced to the county jail for one year with the
alternative of taking the cure in Lexington He was a
short fat little Jew with a round face I would never have
made Benny for junk He had a fair singing voice in a loud
way and his best number was April Showers
One day Benny came into the dayroom all excited
Moishe just checked in he said Hes a panhandler
and a fruit A disgrace to the Jewish race
But Benny someone said hes got a wife and
kids
1 dont care if hes got ten kids Benny said Hes
still a fruit
Moishe showed about an hour later He was a pretty
obvious fruit and strictly on the mooch He was a man of
about sixty with a smooth pink face and white hair
Matty was all over the ward talking to everybody
asking crude blunt questions describing his withdrawal
symptoms in detail He never complained I dont think he
was capable of selfpity Bob Riordan asked him what he
did to get by and Matty replied Im just a dumb fucking
thief He told a story about a drunk asleep on a subway
platform bench I knew he had a roll in his side pocket
but every time I got within ten feet of him hed wake up
and say `What do you want It was easy to see how
Mattys vigorous intrusive emanations would wake up the
lush So I went and found a guy I knew Some old goofball
bum He sat right down by the drunk and in twenty
seconds he had it He cut the pocket
Why didnt you shove him back against the wall and
take the money said Riordan in his goodnatured condescending
way
Matty had unlimited brass and there was no uncertainty
behind it He looked completely unlike a drug addict
If a drugstore refused to sell him a needle he would
say Why wont you sell it to me Do I look like a dope
fiend A doctor had got Matty on stuff The Jew bastard
Matty said he used to say to me `Matty you need
a little shot Theres no color But I made him wish hed
never seen me
I could see a fat old Jewish doctor trying to refuse
Matty a shot on credit Characters like Matty constitute
one of the hazards of pushing They usually have money
When they dont they expect credit If you refuse they
will try to strongarm you They wont listen to no when
they want junk
The cure at Lexington is not designed to keep the
addicts comfortable It starts at onequarter of a grain of
M three times a day and lasts eight days  the preparation
now used is a synthetic morphine called dolophine After
eight days you get a sendoff shot and go over in population
There you receive barbiturates for three nights and
that is the end of medication
For a man with a heavy habit this is a very rough
schedule I was lucky in that I came in sick so the
amount given in the cure was sufficient to fix me The
sicker you are and the longer you have been without junk
the smaller the amount necessary to fix you
When the time came for my sendoff shot I was assigned
to Ward B  Skid Row it was called There was
nothing wrong with the accommodations but the inmates
were a sorrylooking lot In my section there were a bunch
of old bums with the spit running out of their mouths
You are allowed seven days to rest in population after
medication stops Then you have to choose a job and go to
work Lexington has a complete farm and dairy There is a
cannery to put up the fruits and vegetables raised on the
farm The inmates run a dental laboratory where they
make false teeth a radio repair service a library They
serve as janitors they cook and serve food and they act as
assistants to the ward attendants So there is a wide variety
of jobs to select from
I did not figure to stay around long enough to work
After my sendoff shot began to wear off I got sick Just a
shadow of the way I felt when I came in but bad enough
Even with the sedative I did not sleep that night Next day
I was worse I couldnt eat anything and it was an effort
for me to move around The dolophine suspends the sickness
but when medication stops the sickness returns You
dont kick your habit in the shooting gallery an inmate
told me You kick it over here in population `When the
night medication stopped I checked out still sick On a
cold windy afternoon five of us took a cab into Lexington
The thing to do is get right out of Lexington my
companions told me Co right to the bus station and stay
there until your bus leaves Otherwise youre liable to get
the Blue Grass The law was devised among other things
to protect the doctors and druggists of Kentucky against
the importunities of addicts on their way to and from the
Lexington Narcotics Farm It is also intended to discourage
addicts from lingering in the town of Lexington
In Cincinnati I went around to several drugstores
buying oneounce bottles of paregoric Two ounces of
paregoric will fix an addict when his habit is reduced as
mine was at that time I drank three ounces of the paregoric
followed with a little warm water In about ten
minutes I could feel the junk take hold and the sickness
was gone I felt hungry right away and went out of the
hotel to eat
Eventually I got to Texas and stayed off junk for
about four months Then I went to New Orleans New
Orleans presents a stratified series of ruins Along Bourbon
Street are ruins of the 1920s Down where the French
Quarter blends into Skid Row are ruins of an earlier
stratum chili joints decaying hotels oldtime saloons with
mahogany bars spittoons and crystal chandeliers The
ruins of 1900
There are people in New Orleans who have never
been outside the city limits The New Orleans accent is
exactly similar to the accent of Brooklyn The French
Quarter is always crowded Tourists servicemen merchant
seamen gamblers perverts drifters and lamsters from
every State in the Union People wander around unrelated
purposeless most of them looking vaguely sullen and hostile
This is a place where you enjoy yourself Even the
criminals have come here to cool off and relax
But a complex pattern of tensions like the electrical
mazes devised by psychologists to unhinge the nervous
systems of white rats and guinea pigs keeps the unhappy
pleasureseekers in a condition of unconsummated alertness
For one thing New Orleans is inordinately noisy
The drivers orient themselves largely by the use of their
horns like bats The residents are surly The transient
population is completely miscellaneous and unrelated so
that you never know what sort of behavior to expect from
anybody
New Orleans was a strange town to me and I had no
way of making a junk connection Walking around the
city I spotted several junk neighborhoods St Charles and
Poydras the area around and above Lee Circle Canal and
Exchange Place I dont spot junk neighborhoods by the
way they look but by the feel somewhat the same process
by which a dowser locates hidden water I am walking
along and suddenly the junk in my cells moves and
twitches like the dowsers wand Junk here
I didnt see anybody around and besides I wanted to
stay off or at least I thought I wanted to stay off
One night I was in Franks Bar off Exchange Place
drinking a rum and coke It was an equivocal place seamen
and longshoremen queers dealers from the allnight
poker game next door arid some characters who could not
be classified Standing next to me was a middleaged man
with a long thin face and gray hair I asked him if he
would Join me in a beer
He said I would but unfortunately    unfortunately
I am not in a condition to reciprocate Clearly a
man who made his living by physical work selfeducated
a terrific bore once he has spotted you as a man of intelligence
I ordered two beers and he went on telling me how he
was accustomed to reciprocate When the beers came he
said Shall we find a table where we can discuss the state
of the world and the meaning of life without being disturbed
We took our glasses to a table I was preparing an
excuse to leave The man said suddenly Now for example
I know that you are interested in narcotics
How do you know that I asked
I know he said smiling I know that you are here
to investigate narcotics Ive done a lot of work in that line
myself Ive been up to the FBI here fifty times to tell them
what I know You know of course how narcotics ties
right in with Communism I shipped out with the C and A
line last year That line is Communistcontrolled The chief
engineer was one of them I spotted him right away He
used to smoke a pipe and light it with a cigarette lighter
He used the lighter to signal He showed me how the
engineer lighted his pipe with a cigarette lighter and covered
and uncovered the lighter to signal Oh he was
smooth
Signal to whom I asked
I dont know exactly There was a plane that followed
us for a while I could hear it every time he went out
to light his pipe Let me tell you something that may save
you a lot of time The place to look for the information
you want is the Frontier Hotel The same people that run
the Frontier Hotel here control the Standish Hotel in
Philadelphia They are in on narcotics and they are connected
with Communism
Isnt it dangerous for you to talk this way You dont
know who I am Suppose I was on the other side
I know who Im talking to he said If I didnt I
wouldnt be here Id be dead Out of all the people in this
bar I picked you didnt I
Yes but why
There is something that tells me what to do He
showed me a religious medal he wore around his neck If
I didnt carry this I would have stopped a knife or a bullet
long ago
Why are you concerned about narcotics
Because I dont like what it does to people I had a
shipmate who used it
Tell me I said exactly what is the tieup between
narcotics and Communism
You know the answer to that one a lot better than I
do I see you are trying to find out how much I know All
right The same people are in both narcotics and Communism
Right now they control most of America Im a
seaman Ive been shipping out for twenty years Who gets
the jobs over there in the NMU Hall American white men
like you and me No Dagos and Spiks and Niggers Why
Because the union controls shipping and Communists control
the union
Ill be around if you need me he said when I got up
to leave
In the French Quarter there are several queer bars so
full every night the fags spill out on to the sidewalk A
room full of fags gives me the horrors They jerk around
like puppets on invisible strings galvanized into hideous
activity that is the negation of everything living and spontaneous
The live human being has moved out of these
bodies long ago But something moved in when the original
tenant moved out Fags are ventriloquists dummies who
have moved in and taken over the ventriloquist The
dummy sits in a queer bar nursing his beer and uncontrollably
yapping out of a rigid doll face
Occasionally you find intact personalities in a queer
bar but fags set the tone of these joints and it always
brings me down to go into a queer bar The bringdown
piles up After my first week in a new town I have had
about all I can take of these joints so my bar business goes
somewhere else generally to a bar in or near Skid Row
But I backslide now and then One night I got
lobotomized drunk in Franks and went to a queer bar I
must have had more drinks in the queer joint because
there was a lapse of time It was getting light outside when
the bar hit one of those sudden pockets of quiet Quiet is
something that does not often happen in a queer joint I
guess most of the fags had left I was leaning against the
bar with a beer I didnt want in front of me The noise
cleared like smoke and I saw a redhaired kid was looking
straight at me and standing about three feet away
He didnt come on faggish so I said How you making
it or something like that
He said Do you want to go to bed with me
I said OK Lets go
As we walked out he grabbed my bottle of beer off
the bar and stuck it under his coat Outside it was daylight
with the sun just coming up We staggered through the
French Quarter passing the beer bottle back and forth He
was leading the way in the direction of his hotel so he
said I could feel my stomach knot up like I was about to
take a shot after being off the junk a long time I should
have been more alert of course but I never could mix
vigilance and sex All this time he was talking on in a sexy
Southern voice which was not a New Orleans voice and in
the daylight he still looked good
We got to a hotel and he put me down some routine
why he should go in first alone I pulled some bills out of
my pocket He looked at them and said Better give me
the ten
I gave it to him He went in the hotel and came right
out
No rooms there he said Well try the Savoy
The Savoy was right across the street
Wait here he said
I waited about an hour and by then it occurred to me
what was wrong with the first hotel Itd had no back or
side door he could walk out of I went back to my apartment
and got my gun I waited around the Savoy and
looked for the kid through the French Quarter About
noon I got hungry and ate a plate of oysters with a glass
of beer and suddenly felt so tired that when I walked out
of the restaurant my legs were folding under me as if
someone was clipping me behind the knees
I took a cab home and fell across the bed without
taking off my shoes I woke up around six in the evening
and went to Franks After three quick beers I felt better
There was a man standing by the jukebox and I
caught his eye several times He looked at me with a special
recognition like one queer looks at another He looked
like one of those terracotta heads that you plant grass in
A peasant face with peasant intuition stupidity shrewdness
and malice
The jukebox wasnt working I walked over and asked
him what was wrong with it He said he didnt know I
asked him to have a drink and he ordered coke He told me
his name was Pat I told him I had come up recently from
the Mexican border
He said Id like to get down that way me Bring
some stuff in from Mexico
The border is pretty hot I said
I hope you wont take offense at what I say he
began but you look like you use stuff yourself
Sure I use
Do you want to score he asked Im due to score
in a few minutes Ive been trying to hustle the dough If
you buy me a cap I can score for you
I said OK
We walked around the corner past the NMU hail
Wait here a minute he said disappearing into a
bar I halfexpected to get beat for my four dollars but he
was back in a few minutes OK he said I got it
I asked him to come back to my apartment to take a
shot We went back to my room and I got out my outfit
that hadnt been used in five months
If you dont have a habit youd better go slow with
this stuff he cautioned me Its pretty strong
I measured out about twothirds of a cap
Half is plenty he said I tell you its strong
This will be all right I said But as soon as I took
the needle out of the vein I knew it wasnt all right I felt a
soft blow in the heart Pats face began to get black around
the edges the blackness spreading to cover his face 1
could
feel my eyes roll back in their sockets
I came to several hours later Pat was gone I was
lying on the bed with my collar loosened I stood up and
fell to my knees I was dizzy and my head ached Ten
dollars were missing from my watchpocket I guess he
figured I wasnt going to need it any more
Several days later I met Pat in the same bar
Holy Jesus he said I thought you was dying I
loosened your collar and rubbed ice on your neck You
turned all blue So I says `Holy Jesus this man is dying
Im going to get out of here me
A week later I was hooked I asked Pat about the
possibilities of pushing in New Orleans
The town is et up with pigeons he said Its really
tough
So I drifted along scoring through Pat I stopped
drinking stopped going out at night and fell into a routine
schedule a cap of junk three times a day and the time in
between to be filled somehow Mostly I spent my time
painting and working around the house Manual work
makes the time pass fast Of course it often took me a
long time to score
When I first hit New Orleans the main pusher  or
the Man as they say there  was a character called Yellow
Yellow was so named because his complexion was
yellow and liverishlooking He was a thin little man with a
dragging limp He operated out of a bar near the NMU
hail and occasionally choked down a beer to justify sitting
in the bar several hours a day He was out on bail at the
time and when his case came to trial he drew two years
A period of confusion followed during which it was
difficult to find a score Sometimes I spent six or eight
hours riding around in the car with Pat waiting and looking
for different people who might be holding Finally Pat
ran into a wholesale connection a dollarfifty per cap no
less than twenty This connection was Joe Brandon one of
the few pushers I ever knew who didnt use the stuff himself
Pat and I began pushing in a small way just enough
to keep up our habits We only took care of people Pat
knew well and was sure of Dupré was our best customer
He was a dealer in a gambling joint and always had money
But he was a hog for junk and so couldnt keep his hand
out of the till Eventually he lost his job
Don an old neighborhood friend of Pats had a city
job He inspected something but was off half the time sick
He never had money for more than one cap and most of
the money he did have was given him by his sister Pat told
me Don had cancer
Well I said 1 guess he]] die soon
He did He took to his bed vomited for a week and
died
Seltzer Willy owned a seltzer truck and had a seltzer
delivery route This business bought him two caps a
day but he was not a very enterprising seltzer pusher He
was a thin redhaired mildmannered man the type described
as harmless
Hes timid said Pat Timid and stupid
There were a few others who dropped by for an occasional
bang One was called Whitey  I never found out
why because he was dark  a fattish stupid man who
worked as a waiter in one of the big hotels He figured that
if he paid for one cap be was entitled to the next cap on
credit Once after Pat turned him down he rushed to the
door in a rage and held up a nickel See this nickel he
said Youre going to be sorry you turned me down Im
going to call the People on you
I told Pat wed better stop serving Whitey
Yes said Pat but he knows where I live We ought
to find another place
Another occasional was Lonny the Pimp who had
grown up in his mothers whorehouse Lonny tried to space
his shots so he wouldnt get a habit He was always beefing
how he couldnt clear anything now he had to put out so
much for hotel rooms and the law kept him on the move
See what I mean he said Theres no percentage
Lonny was pure pimp He was skinny and nervous
He couldnt sit still and he couldnt shut up As he talked
he moved his thin hands which were covered on the backs
with long greasy black hairs You could tell by looking at
him that he had a big penis Pimps always do Lonny was a
sharp dresser arid he drove a Buick convertible But he
wouldnt hesitate to hang us up for credit on a twodollar
cap
After he took the shot hed say as he rolled down the
sleeve of his striped silk shirt and fastened his cufflinks
Look boys Im a little short You dont mind putting this
one on the cuff do you You know Im good for it
Pat would look at him with his little bloodshot eyes A
surly peasant look For Chris sake Lonny we have to
put out for this stuff How would you like it if people came
in on you laid your girls and then wanted to put it on the
cuff Pat shook his head Youre like all of them Once
they get it in the vein thats all they care Here I have a
cool place where they can come and shoot and what consideration
do I get Once they get it in the vein thats all
they care
Well look Pat I dont want to hang you up Now
heres a dollar and Ill bring the rest this afternoon OK
Pat took the dollar and put it in his pocket without
saying anything He pursed his lips in disapproval
Seltzer Willy dropped by around ten oclock on his
route took a cap and bought a cap for the night Dupré
came in around twelve when he got off work He was art
the night shift The others came any time they had the
inclination
Bob Brandon our connection was out on bail He
was charged in State Court with possession of junk a
felony under Louisiana law The case against him was
based on traces  that is he got rid of the junk before the
cops shook his place down But he did not wash out the
jars in which the junk had been kept The Federals will not
take a traces case so the State took it This is regular
procedure in Louisiana Any case too shaky for the Federal
Courts passes to the State Courts who will prosecute
anything Brandon expected to beat the case He had good
connections with the political machine and in any event
the State had a weak case But the DA dragged in Brandons
record which included a murder conviction and he
drew two to five years
Pat found another connection right away and we went
on pushing A peddler named Jonkers began selling on the
corner of Exchange and Canal Pat lost a few customers to
Jonkers Actually Jonkers stuff was better and sometimes
I scored from Jonkers or Jonkers partner an old oneeyed
character named Richter Pat always found out
somehow  he was intuitive as a possessive mother  and
then he would sulk for two or three days
Jonkers and Richter did not last long Exchange and
Canal is one of the hottest spots in New Orleans for junk
One day they were gone and Pat said Now youll see
some of those guys come back to me I told Lonny `If you
want to score off Jonkers go ahead but dont come back
here and expect me to serve you Youll see what I tell him
if he comes back here Whitey too Hes been scoring off
Jonkers Pat gave me a long sullen look
One day the woman who managed Pats hotel stopped
me in the lobby I just want to tell you to be careful she
said The cops were here yesterday and made a thorough
investigation of Pats room And they arrested the boy with
the seltzer truck Hes in jail now
I thanked her A little later Pat came in He told me
the cops had grabbed Seltzer Willy as he left the hotel
They didnt find any junk on him so they took him to the
third precinct to hold for investigation He was there
seventytwo hours which is the longest period they can
hold anyone without placing charges
The cops searched Pats room but he kept his junk
stashed in the hall so they didnt find it Pat said They
told me `We have information youre running a regular
shooting gallery up here Youd better pack in because
next time were going to come and take you thats all
Well I said better pack in except for Dupré No
harm to serve him
Dupré lost his job Pat said Hes already into me
for twenty dollars
We were back looking for a score every day We
found out that Lonny was the Man That is the way it
went in New Orleans You never knew who was going to
be the Man next
About this time an antinarcotics drive hit the town
The chief of police said This drive is going to continue as
long as there is a single violator left in this city The State
legislators drew up a law making it a crime to be a drug
addict They did not specify where or when or what they
meant by drug addict
The cops began stopping addicts on the street and
examining their arms for needle marks If they found
marks they pressured the addict to sign a statement admitting
his condition so he could be charged under the drug
addicts law The addicts were promised a suspended sentence
if they would plead guilty and get the new law
started
Addicts ransacked their persons looking for veins to shoot
in outside the arm area If the law could find no marks on
a man they usually let him go If they found marks they
would hold him for seventytwo hours and try to make him
sign a statement
Lonnys wholesale connection gave out and a character
called Old Sam was the Man Old Sam was after
doing twelve years in Angola He operated in the territory
directly above Lee Circle which is another hot spot in
New Orleans for junk or anything
One day I was broke and I wrapped up a pistol to take
it in town and pawn it When I got to Pats roam there
were two people there One was Red McKinney a
shriveledup crippled junkie; the other was a young merchant
seaman named Cole Cole did not have a habit at
this time and he wanted to connect for some weed He was
a real tea head He told me he could not enjoy himself
without weed I have seen people like that For them tea
occupies the place usually filled by liquor They dont have
to have it in any physical sense but they cannot have a
really good time without it
As it happened I had several ounces of weed in my
house Cole agreed to buy four caps in exchange for two
ounces of weed We went out to my place Cole tried the
weed and said it was good So we started out to score
Red said he knew a connection on Julia Street We
should be able to find him there now
Pat was sitting at the wheel of my car on the nod We
were on the ferry crossing from Algiers where I lived to
New Orleans Suddenly Pat looked up and opened his
bloodshot eyes
That neighborhood is too hot he said loudly
Where else can we score said McKinney Old Sam
is up that way too
I tell you that neighborhood is too hot Pat repeated
He looked around resentfully as though what he
saw was unfamiliar and distasteful
There was in fact no place else to score Without a
word Pat started driving in the direction of Lee Circle
When we came to Julia Street McKinney said to Cole
Give me the money because we are subject to see him any
time He walks around this block A walking connection
Cole gave McKinney fifteen dollars We circled the
block three times slowly but McKinney did not see the
Man
Well I guess well have to try Old Sam McKinney
said
We began looking for Old Sam above Lee Circle Old
Sam was not in the old frame rooming house where he
lived We drove around slowly Every now and then Pat
would see someone he knew and stop the car No one had
seen Old Sam Some of the characters Pat called to just
shrugged in a disagreeable way and kept walking
Those guys wouldnt tell you nothing Pat said It
hurts `em to do anybody a favor
We parked the car near Old Sams rooming house
and McKinney walked down to the corner to buy a package
of cigarettes He came back limping fast and got in the
car
The law he said Lets get out of here
We started away from the curb and a prowl car
passed us I saw the cop at the wheel turn around and do a
doubletake when he saw Pat
Theyve made us Pat I said Get going
Pat didnt need to be told He gunned the car and
turned a corner heading for Corondolet I turned to Cole
who was in the back seat Throw out that weed I ordered
Wait a minute Cole replied We may lose them
Are you crazy I said Pat McKinney and I yelled
in chorus Throw it out
We were on Corondolet headed downtown Cole
threw the weed out and it skidded under a parked car Pat
took the first right turn into a oneway street The prowl
car was coming down the same street from the other end
going the wrong way An old cop trick We were boxed in
I heard Cole yell Oh Lord Ive got another stick on
me
The cops jumped out with their hands on their guns
but they did not draw them They ran up to my car One of
them the driver who had spotted Pat had a big smile on
his face Where did you get the car Pat he asked
The other cop opened the back door Everybody
out he said
McKinney and Cole were in the back seat They got
out and the cops went through them Right away the cop
who spotted Pat found the stick of weed in Coles shirt
pocket
Ive got enough here to hold the whole bunch of
them he said This cop had a smooth red face and he
kept smiling all the time He found my gun in the glove
compartment This is a foreign gun he said Have you
got it registered with the Internal Revenue Department
I thought that only applied to full automatic weapons
I said that fire more than one shot with one pull of
the trigger
No said the cop smiling it applies to all foreign
automatics I knew he was wrong but there was no percentage
in telling him so He looked at my arms Youve
been hooking that spot so much its about to get infected
he said pointing to a needle welt
The wagon arrived and we all got in We were taken
to the second precinct The cops looked at my car papers
They couldnt believe that the car was mine I was searched
at least six times by different people Eventually we were
all locked in a cell about six by eight feet Pat smiled and
rubbed his hands together
Theyre going to be some sick fucking dope fiends in
here he said
A little later the turnkey came and called my name I
was taken to a small room that opened off the reception
room of the precinct In the room were two detectives sitting
at a table One was tall and fat with a deep South frog
face The other was a middleaged stocky Irish cop He
was missing some front teeth which gavehis face a suggestion
of harelip This type cop could just as well be an
oldtime rodriding thug There was nothing of the bureaucrat
about him
The frogfaced cop was obviously in charge of the
questioning He told me to sit down at the table opposite
him He pushed a package of cigarettes and a box of
matches across the table Have a cigarette he said The
Irish cop was sitting at the end of the table to my left He
was close enough to reach me without getting up The cop
in charge was studying the papers of my car Everything
they had taken out of my pockets was spread on the table
in front of him a glass case identification papers wallet
keys a letter from a friend in New York everything but
my pocketknife which the smoothfaced cop from the patrol
car had put in his pocket
Suddenly I remembered about that letter The friend
in New York whod written it was a tea head and he
pushed weed from time to time Hed written to me asking
the price of good weed in New Orleans I asked Pat who
quoted me a tentative price of forty dollars per pound In
the letter on the table my friend made reference to the
fortydollar rate and said he wanted some at that figure
At first I thought they might pass over the letter They
were on the Stolen Car Squad and they wanted a stolen
car They kept looking at the papers and asking questions
When I couldnt remember exact dates on the car that was
the clincher They seemed on the point of getting tough
Finally I said Well its just a question of checking
When you check youll find out that Im telling the truth
and the car is mine But there is no way I can convince
you by talking Of course if you want me to say I stole the
car I will But when you check youll find out the car is
mine
Well check all right
The frogfaced cop folded the car papers carefully and
put them aside He picked up the envelope and looked at
the address and the postmark Then he took the letter out
He read the letter to himself Then he read aloud skipping
where there was no reference to weed He put the letter
down and looked at me
Not only do you use weed he said you peddle it
too and youve got a batch of this weed stashed somewhere
He looked at the letter About forty pounds He
looked at me Youd better straighten yourself out
I didnt say anything
The old Irish cop said Hes like all these guys He
aint talking Till they get their fucking ribs kicked in Then
theyll talk and be glad to talk
Were going out and search your house the frogfaced
cop said If we find anything your wife will be put
in jail too I dont know what will happen to your children
Theyll have to go to some home
Why dont you make the man a proposition the old
Irish cop said
I knew that if they searched the house they would find
the stuff Call in the Federals and Ill show you where the
stuff is I said But I want your word that the case will be
tried in Federal and that my wife will not be molested
The frogfaced cop nodded All right he said I
accept your proposition He turned to his partner Go
call Rogers he said
A few minutes later the old cop was back Rogers is
out of town and wont be back until morning and Williams
is sick
Well call Hauser
We went out and got in the car The old cop was
driving and the captain was sitting in back with me
This is it here said the captain
The old cop stopped the car and honked A man with
a pipe came out of the house and got in the back seat He
looked at me and then looked away puffing on his pipe
The man looked young in the dark but when we passed
under a street light I saw that his face was wrinkled and
he had black circles under the eyes It was a cleancut
Americanboy face a face that had aged but could not
mature I assumed that he was a Federal agent
After smoking in silence for several blocks the agent
turned to me and took out his pipe Who are you scoring
off now he asked
Its hard to find a score now I said Most of them
have gone away
He began asking me who I knew and I mentioned a
number of people who had already gone away He seemed
pleased with this worthless information If you dummy up
on cops they will slap you around They want you to give
them something even if what you give has no conceivable
use
He asked what record I had and I told him about the
script case in New York
How much time did you do on that he asked
None Its a misdemeanor in New York Public
Health law Public Health Law Number 334 as I remember
Hes pretty well versed said the old cop
The captain was explaining to the agent that I seemed
to have a particular fear of the State Courts and that he
had made a deal with me to turn the case over to the
Federals
Well said the agent thats the way the captain is
Hell treat you right if you treat him right He smoked for
a while We were on the ferry to Algiers Theres an easy
way and a hard way of doing things he said finally
When we got to the house the captain grabbed me by
the back of the belt Whos in there besides your wife
I said Nobody
We came to the door and the guy with the pipe
showed my wife his hunk of tin and opened the door I
showed them the pound of weed I had in the house and a
few caps of junk This didnt satisfy the captain He
wanted forty pounds of weed
Youre not coming up with all of it Bill he kept
saying Come on now Weve shown you every courtesy
I told them there wasnt any more
The man with the pipe looked at me We want it
all he said His eyes did not want anything very much He
was standing under the light His face had not only aged it
had decayed He had the look of a man suffering from a
fatal illness
I said Youve got it all
He looked vaguely away and began poking about in
drawers and closets He found some old letters which he
read sitting on his heels on the floor I wondered why he
didnt sit in a chair Evidently he did not want to be
comfortable while reading someone elses mail The two
cops from Stolen Cars were getting bored Finally they
collected the weed the caps and a 38 revolver I kept in
the house and got ready to leave
He belongs to Uncle now said the captain to my
wife as they left the house
They drove back to the Second Precinct and I was
locked in This time I was locked in a different cell Pat
and McKinney were in the next cell over Pat called to me
and asked what happened
Thats tough he said when I told him
Pat had given a wagonchasing lawyer ten dollars to
get
him out in the morning
I was in a cell with four strangers three of them
addicts There was only one bench and that was occupied
so the rest of us stood up or lay down on the floor I lay
down on the floor beside a man named McCarthy I had
seen him around town He had been in for almost seventytwo
hours Every now and then he would groan slightly
Once he said Isnt this hell
A junky runs on junk time When his junk is cut off
the clock runs down and stops All he can do is hang on
and wait for nonjunk time to start A sick junkie has no
escape from external time no place to go He can only
wait
Cole was talking about Yokohama All that good
Henry and Charly When you shoot Henry and Charly
you can smell it going in
McCarthy groaned hollowly from the floor Man
he said dont talk about that stuff
Next morning we were taken to lineup A kid with
epilepsy was ahead of us on the stage The cops took a
long time wisecracking with this subnormal character
How long you been in New Orleans
Thirtyfive days
What have you been doing all that time
Ive been in jail thirtythree days
They thought that was funny and batted it around for
another five minutes or so
When our turn came the cop who ran the lineup
read off the circumstances of the case
How many times you been here they asked Pat
Some cop laughed and said About forty times
They asked each of us how many times arrested and
how much time done When they came to me they asked
how much time I did on the New York script charge I
said None I got a suspended sentence
Well said the cop in charge of the lineup Youll
get one here too
All of a sudden there was a tremendous slobbering
and screaming off stage and I thought for a minute the
cops were working over the epileptic But when I walked
off the stage I saw that he was flopping around on the
floor in a fit while two detectives were hovering around
trying to talk to him Someone went for a doctor
We were locked in a cell A fat dick who seemed to
know Pat came and stood at the door The guys a psycho
he said Hes saying now `Take me to my captain
A psycho I sent for the doctor
After two hours or so they took us back to the precinct
where we waited some more hours About noon the
guy with the pipe and another man came to the precinct
and drove a bunch of us over to the Federal Building The
new man was young and fattish He was chewing on a
cigar Cole McCarthy I and two Negroes piled into the
back seat The guy with the cigar was driving He took his
cigar out and turned to me
What is it you do Mr Lee he asked politely in the
accents of an educated man
Farm I answered
The man with the pipe laughed
Corn with weed between the rows eh he said
The man with the cigar shook his head No he said
It wont grow well in corn It has to grow by itself
He
turned to McCarthy speaking over his shoulder Im
going to send you up to the penitentiary at Angola he
said
Why Mr Morton asked McCarthy
Because youre a goddamned drug addict
Not me Mr Morton
What about those needle marks
I have syphilis Mr Morton
All junkies have syphilis said Morton His voice
was cool condescending amused
The guy with the pipe was making an unsuccessful
attempt to kid one of the Negroes The Negro was called
Clutch because of a deformed hand
Old monkey climbing up on your back asked the
man with the pipe
I dont know what youre talking about now said
Clutch It was just a flat statement There was no insolence
Clutch did not have a junk habit and he was saying
so
They parked in front of the Federal Building and took
us up to the fourth floor Here we waited around in an
outer office and were summoned to the inner office one at a
time for questioning When my turn came I walked in and
the man with the cigar was sitting at a table He motioned
me to a chair
Im Mr Morton he said A Federal narcotics
agent Do you want to make a statement As you know
you have a Constitutional right to refuse Of course it
takes more time for you to be charged in the event you do
not make a statement
I said I would make a statement
The man with the pipe was there
Bill isnt feeling very well today he said Maybe a
little shot of heroin would help
Maybe I said He began asking me questions some
of them so pointless that I could hardly believe what I
heard Clearly he had no cop intuition No way of knowing
what was important and what was not
Who are your connections in Texas
I dont have any This was true
Do you want to see your wife in jail
I wiped the sweat off my face with a handkerchief
No I said
Well shes going to be in jail She uses this benzedrine
Thats worse than junk Are you and your wife
legally married
Common law
I asked are you and your wife legally married
No
Have you studied psychiatry
What
I asked have you studied psychiatry
He had read a letter from a friend of mine who is a
psychiatrist In fact he had taken all my old letters away
with him after he searched the house
No I have not studied psychiatry Just a hobby you
might say
You have some peculiar hobbies
Morton leaned back in his chair and yawned
The man with the pipe suddenly doubled his fist and
hit himself in the chest Im a cop see he said Wherever
I go I associate with cops Your business is narcotics
It stands to reason you know the other people in your line
of business We dont deal with people like you once a
month We deal with them every day You werent alone in
this You have connections in New York Texas and here
in New Orleans Now you had some deal lined up something
was about to materialize
I think well let this farmer do his fanning up at
Angola if he cant give us any information said Morton
What about this hotcar ring said the man with the
pipe turning his back to me and walking across the room
What hotcar ring I asked really surprised It was
sometime later I remembered a letter five years old that
contained a reference to stolen cars He went on and on
He mopped his brow and stalked around the room Finally
Morton cut him short
As I see it Mr Lee he said you are prepared to
admit your own guilt but not to involve anybody else is
that correct
Thats correct I said
He shifted his cigar Well he said thats all for the
present How many more out there he called
A cop stuck his head in About five
Morton made a movement of exasperation Theres
no time I have to be in court at one oclock Bring them
all in
All the others came in and stood around in front of
the table Morton leafed through a stack of papers He
looked at McCarthy and turned to a young agent with a
crewcut
Have you got anything on him he asked
The agent shook his head and smiled He raised one
foot See this foot he said to McCarthy Im going to
put it right down your throat
Im not fooling with stuff Mr Morton said Mc
Carthy because I dont want to go to the penitentiary
What were you doing standing on the corner with
those other junkies
I just walked by I was Regaling up Mr Morton
The reference is to Regal Beer a New Orleans product
I Regal up every chance I get Look here He took some
cards out of his wallet and showed them around like a
magician about to do a card trick Nobody looked at the
cards I work as a waiter and heres my union card I can
get on at the Roosevelt over the weekend Theres a convention
stopping there Its a good deal if you guys will let
me go
He walked over to Morton and held out his hand
Give me a dime Mr Morton for carfare
Morton slapped a coin into his hand
Get your cottonpicking ass out of here he said
Well get you next time the agents shouted in
chorus but Mccarthy was out the door
The young agent with the crewcut laughed Ill bet he
took the stairs
Morton was gathering up his papers and shoving them
into a briefcase Im sorry he said but I cant take any
more statements from the rest of you this afternoon
I sent for the wagon said the guy with the pipe
Well take them over to the Third Precinct and put them
on ice
At the Third Precinct Cole and I had a cell to Ourselves
I lay down on the bench There was a raw ache
through my lungs People vary in the way funk sickness
affects them Some suffer mostly from vomiting and diarrhea
The asthmatic type with narrow and deep chest is
liable to violent fits of sneezing watering at eyes and nose
in same cases spasms of the bronchial tubes that shut off
the breathing In my case the worst thing is lowering of
blood pressure with consequent loss of body liquid and
extreme weakness as in shock It is a feeling as if the life
energy has been shut off so that all the cells in the body are
suffocating As 1 lay there on the bench I felt like I was
subsiding into a pile of bones
We were in the Third Precinct about three hours and
then the laws put us in the wagon and took us to Parish
Prison for no reason that I could see The man with the
pipe met us at Parish and took us to the Federal Building
A middleaged faceless bureaucrat told me he was
head of the New Orleans office Did I want to make a
statement
Yes I said You write it and Ill sign it
His face wasnt blank or expressionless It simply
wasnt there The only thing I remember about his face is
that he wore glasses He called in a stenographer and got
ready to dictate a statement He turned to the man with the
pipe who was sitting there on a desk and asked if there
was anything special he wanted to put in the statement
The man with the pipe said Well no thats the
whole story
The head bureaucrat seemed to think of something
Wait a minute he said He led the man with the pipe
into another office They came back after a few minutes
and the bureaucrat went on with his statement The statement
admitted possession of the weed and heroin found in
my house
He asked how I acquired the heroin
I said I went to Exchange and Canal and contacted a
street peddler
What did you do then he asked
I drove home
In your own car
I saw what he was getting at but did not have the
energy to say I changed my mind I dont want to make
any statement Besides I was afraid of spending another
day sick in the precinct So I said Yes
Finally I signed a separate statement to the effect that
it was my intention to plead guilty to these charges in
Federal Court I was taken back to the Second Precinct
The agents assured me I would be charged first thing the
next morning
Cole said Youll feel better in five days Only time
or a shot will take away the bad feeling
I knew this of course No one will stand still for junk
sickness unless he is in jail or otherwise cut off from junk
The reason it is practically impossible to stop using and
cure yourself is that the sickness lasts five to eight days
Twelve hours of it would be easy twentyfour possible but
five to eight days is too long
I lay on the narrow wood bench twisting from one
side to the other My body was raw twitching tumescent
the junkfrozen flesh in agonizing thaw I turned over on
my stomach and one leg slipped off the bench I pitched
forward and the rounded edge of the bench polished
smooth by the friction of cloth slid along my crotch
There was a sudden rush of blood to my genitals at the
slippery contact Sparks exploded behind my eyes; my legs
twitched  the orgasm of a hanged man when the neck
snaps
The turnkey opened the door of my cell Your lawyer
is here to see you Lee he said
The lawyer looked at me quite a while before he introduced
himself He had been recommended to my wife
and I had not seen him before The turnkey led the way to
a large room above the cell block where there were
benches
I can see you dont feel much like talking now the
lawyer began Well go into the details later on Did you
sign anything
I told him about the statement
That was to get your car he said Youre charged
in State I talked to the Federal DA an hour ago on the
phone and asked if he was going to take the case He said
`Absolutely no Theres an illegal seizure involved and
under no circumstances will this office prosecute the case
I think I can get you over to the hospital for a shot he
said after a pause The man at the desk now is a good
friend of mine Ill go down and talk to him
The turnkey took me back to my cell A few minutes
later he opened the door again and said Lee do you want
to go to the hospital
Two cops took me over to Charity Hospital in the
wagon The nurse at the receiving desk wanted to know
what was wrong with me
Emergency case said one of the cops He fell off a
building
The cop walked away and came back with a heavyset
young doctor with reddish hair and goldrimmed glasses
The doctor asked a few questions and looked at my arms
Another doctor with a long nose and hairy arms walked up
to put in his two cents
After all doctor he said to his colleague there is
the moral question This man should have thought of all
this before he started using narcotics
Yes there is the moral question but there is also a
physical question This man is sick He turned to a nurse
and ordered half a grain of morphine
As the wagon jolted along on the way back to the
precinct I felt the morphine spread through all my cells
My stomach moved and rumbled A shot when you are
very sick always starts the stomach moving Normal
strength came back to all my muscles I was hungry and
sleepy
About eleven the next morning a bondsman came
around so I could sign the bond He had the embalmed
look of all bondsmen as though paraffin had been injected
under the skin My lawyer Tige showed up around twelve
to check me out He had made arrangements for me to go
directly to a sanitarium to take a cure He told me the
cure was necessary from a legal point of view We drove
to a sanitarium in a police car with two detectives This
was part of the lawyers plan and the detectives fitted in
as possible witnesses
When we stopped in front of the sanitarium the lawyer
pulled some bills out of his pocket and turned to one of
the cops Put this on that horse for me will you he
said
The dicks frogeyes bugged out with indignation He
made no move to take the money Im not going to put
any money on a horse he said
The lawyer laughed and tossed the money onto the
seat of the car Mack will he said
This apparent tactlessness in paying off the cops in
front of me was deliberate When they asked him later
what was the idea he said Why that boy was too sick to
notice anything So if these two cops were called as witness
they would say I seemed in very bad shape The point
was the lawyer wanted witnesses who would testify I was
in bad shape at the time I signed the statement
An attendant took my clothes and I lay down on the
bed waiting for a shot My wife came to see me and reported
that the management did not know anything about
junk or junkies
When I told them you were sick they said `Whats
the mailer with him I told them you were sick and that
you needed a shot of morphine and they said `Oh we
thought it was just a question of a marijuana habit
A marijuana habit I said What in hell is that
Find out what they plan to give me I told her I need a
reduction cure If they arent going to give me one check
me out of here right now
She came back shortly and told me she finally got a
doctor on the phone who seemed to know what the score
was This was the lawyers doctor who was not connected
with the sanitarium
He seemed surprised when I told him you hadnt had
anything He said he would call the hospital right away
and see that you were taken care of
A few minutes later a nurse came in with a hypo It
was demerol Demerol helps some but it is not nearly as
effective as codeine in relieving junk sickness A doctor
came that evening to give me a physical examination My
blood was thick and concentrated by loss of body fluid
During the fortyeight hours I had been without junk I
lost ten pounds It took the doctor twenty minutes to draw
a tube of blood for a blood test because the thick blood
kept clotting in the needle
At nine pm I got another shot of demerol This shot
had no effect The third day and night of junk sickness are
generally the worst After the third day the sickness begins
to recede I felt a cold burn over the whole surface of my
body as though the skin was one solid hive It seemed like
ants were crawling around under the skin
It is possible to detach yourself from most pain
injury to teeth eyes and genitals present special difficulties
 so that the pain is experienced as neutral excitation
From junk sickness there seems to be no escape Junk
sickness is the reverse side of junk kick The kick of junk is
that you have to have it Junkies run on junk time and
junk metabolism They are subject to junk climate They
are warmed and chilled by junk The kick of junk is living
under junk conditions You cannot escape from junk sickness
any more than you can escape from junk kick after a
shot
I was too weak to get out of bed I could trot lie still
In junk sickness any conceivable line of action or inaction
seems intolerable A man might die simply because he
could not stand to stay in his body
At six oclock in the morning I got another shot
which seemed to have some effect As I learned later this
shot was not demerol I was even able to eat a little toast
and drink some coffee
When my wife came to see me later in the day she
told me that they were using a new treatment in my case
The treatment had started with my morning shot
I noticed a difference I thought the morning shot
was M
I talked to Dr Moore on the phone He told me this
is the wonder drug they have been looking for to treat drug
addiction It relieves withdrawal symptoms without forming
a new habit It isnt a narcotic at all It is one of the
antihistamines Thephorin I believe he said
Then it would seem withdrawal symptoms are an
allergic reaction
Thats what Dr Moore says
The doctor who recommended this treatment was my
lawyers doctor He was not connected with the sanitarium
and he was not a psychiatrist In two days I could eat a full
meal The antihistamine shots lasted three to five hours
and then the sickness came back The shots felt like junk
When I was up and walking around a psychiatrist
came to interview me He was very tall He had long legs
and a heavy body shaped like a pear with the narrow end
up He smiled when he talked and his voice was whiny He
was not effeminate He simply had none of whatever it is
that makes a man a man This was Dr Fredericks head
psychiatrist of the hospital
He asked the question they all ask Why do you feel
that you need narcotics Mr Lee
When you hear this question you can be sure that the
man who asks it knows nothing about junk
I need it to get out of bed in the morning to shave
and eat breakfast
I mean psychically
I shrugged Might as well give him his diagnosis so he
will go Its a good kick
Junk is not a good kick The point of junk to a user
is that it forms the habit No one knows what junk is until
he is junk sick
The doctor nodded Psychopathic personality He
stood up Suddenly he moved his face into a smile that was
obviously intended to be understanding and to dissolve my
reticence The smile took over and ended up an insane leer
He leaned forward and brought his smile close to my face
Is your sex life satisfactory he asked Do you and
your wife have satisfactory relations
Oh yes I said when Im not on the junk
He straightened up He didnt like my answer at all
Well Ill see you again He blushed and lunged
awkwardly for the door I had made him for a faker when
he walked in the room  obviously he was putting down a
self assured routine for himself and the others  but I had
expected a deeper and tougher front
The doctor told my wife I had a very bad prognosis
My attitude towards junk was so what A relapse was to
be expected because the psychic determinants of my condition
remained in operation He could not help me unless I
agreed to cooperate Given cooperation he apparently was
ready to take down my psyche and reassemble it in eight
days
The other patients were a pretty square and sorry lot
Not another junky in the place The only patient in my
ward who knew the score was a drunk who came in with a
broken jaw and other injuries of the face He told me all
the public hospitals turned him away At Charity they told
him Get out of here Youre dripping blood all over the
floor So he came to this sanitarium where he had been
before and they knew he was good for the bill
The others were a beat nowhere bunch of people The
type psychiatrists like The type Dr Fredericks could impress
There was a thin pale little man with bloodless
almost transparent flesh He looked like a cold and enfeebled
lizard This character complained of nerves and
spent most of the day wandering up and down the halls
saying Lord Lord I dont even feel like a human He
did not have the concentration of energy necessary to hold
himself together and his organism was always on the point
of disintegrating into its component parts
Most of the patients were old They looked at you
with the puzzled resentful stupid look of a moribund cow
A few never left their rooms One young schizophrenic had
both hands fastened in front with a bandage so he could
not bother the other patients A depressing place and depressing
people
I was feeling the shots less all the time and after eight
days I began to pass them up When I had passed the shots
for twentyfour hours I decided it was time to leave
My wife went to see Dr Fredericks and caught him in
the hail outside his office He said I should stay four or five
days longer He doesnt know it yet the doctor said but
his shots are stopped from now on
Hes already passed up the shots for twentyfour
hours my wife told him
The doctor got very red in the face When he could
talk he said Anyway he might develop withdrawal
symptoms
It isnt likely after ten days is it
He might said the doctor and walked away before
she could say anything else
To hell with him I told her We dont need his
testimony Tige wants to use his own doctor as a witness to
my condition No telling what this jerk might say on the
stand
Dr Fredericks had to sign my discharge from the
hospital He stayed in his office and a nurse took the paper
in so he could sign it Of course he wrote against medical
advice on the discharge
It was five in the afternoon when we left the hospital
and took a cab to Canal Street I went into a bar and drank
four whisky sodas and got a good lush kick I was cured
As I walked across the porch of my house and opened
the door I had the feel of returning after a long absence I
was coming back to the point in time I left a year ago
when I took that first joy bang with Pat
After a junk cure is complete you generally feel fine
for a few days You can drink you can feel real hunger
and pleasure in food and your sex desire comes back to
you Everything looks different sharper Then you hit a
sag It is an effort to dress get out of a chair pick up a
fork You dont want to do anything or go anywhere You
dont even want junk The junk craving is gone but there
isnt anything else You have to sit this period out Or work
it out Farm work is the best cure
Pat came around as soon as he heard I was out Did I
want to pick up Just one wouldnt hurt any He could
get a good price on ten or more I said no You dont need
will power to say no to junk when you are off You dont
want it
Besides I was charged in State and State junk raps
pile up like any other felony Two junk raps can draw you
seven years or you can be charged in State on one and
Federal on the other so that when you walk out of the
State joint the Federals meet you at the door If you do
your Federal time first then the State is waiting for you at
the door of the Federal joint
I knew the law was out to hang another on me because
they had messed up the deal by coming on like
Federals and by searching the house without a warrant I
had a free hand to arrange my account of what happened
since there was no statement with my signature on it to tie
me down The State could not introduce the statement I
had signed for the Federals without bringing up the deal I
had made with that fairplay artist the fat captain But if
they could hang another charge on me they would have a
sure thing
Usually a junky makes straight for a connection as
soon as he leaves any place of confinement The law would
expect me to do this and they would be watching Pat So I
told Pat I was staying off until the case was settled He
borrowed two dollars and went away
A few days later I was drinking in the bars around
Canal Street When a junky off junk gets drunk to a certain
point his thoughts turn to junk I went into the toilet in
one bar and there was a wallet on the toiletpaper box
There is a dream feeling when you find money I opened
the wallet and took out a twenty a ten and a five I decided
to use some other toilet in same other bar and walked out
leaving a full martini
I went up to Pats room
Pat opened the door and said Hello old buddy Im
glad to see you
Sitting on the bed was another man who turned his
face to the door as I came in Hello Bill he said
I looked at him a long three seconds before I recognized
Dupré He looked older and younger The deadness
had gone from his eyes and he was twenty pounds thinner
His face twitched at intervals like dead matter coming
alive still jerky and mechanical When he was getting
plenty of junk Dupré looked anonymous and dead so you
could not pick him out of a crowd or recognize him at a
distance Now his image was clear and sharp If you
walked fast down a crowded street and passed Dupré his
face would be forced on your memory  like in the card
trick where the operator fans the cards rapidly saying
Take a card any card as he forces a certain card into
your hand
When he was getting plenty of junk Dupré was silent
Now he was garrulous He told me how he finally got so
deep in the till he lost his job Now he had no money for
junk He couldnt even raise the price of PG and goofballs
to taper off He talked on and on
It used to be all the cops knew me before the War
Manys the seventytwo hours I put in right over in the
Third Precinct It was the First Precinct then You know
how it is when you start to come off the stuff He indicated
his genitals pointing with all his fingers then turning
the hand palm up A concrete gesture as though he had
picked up what he wanted to talk about and was holding it
in his palm to show you You get a hardon and shoot off
right in your pants It doesnt even have to get hard I
remember one time I was in with Larry You know that
kid Larry He was pushing a while back I said `Larry you
got to do it for me So he took down his pants You know
he had to do that for me
Pat was looking for a vein He pursed his lips in
disapproval You guys talk like degenerates
What the matter Pat I said Cant you hit it
No he said He moved the tieup down to his wrist
to hit a vein in his hand
Later I stopped by my lawyers office to talk about
the case and to ask whether I could leave the State and go
to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas where I owned farm
property
Youre hot as a firecracker in this town Tige told
me I have permission from the judge for you to leave the
State So you can go on to Texas any time you like
I might want to take a trip to Mexico I said
Would that be okay
So long as you are back here when your case comes
up There are no restrictions on you One client of mine
went to Venezuela So far as I know hes still there He
didnt come back
Tige was a hard man to figure Was be telling me not
to come back When he seemed to come on clumsy or
irrelevant he was often following a plan Some of his plans
extended far into the future Often he would take up a
plan see that it was nowhere and drop it For an intelligent
man be could get some amazingly silly ideas For
example when I told him I had studied medicine in Vienna
six months he said
Thats fine Now suppose we say this That you having
studied medicine yourself had confidence that with
your medical knowledge you could administer a cure to
yourself and that it was for this purpose of giving yourself
a cure that you acquired the drugs that were found in your
possession
I thought this was too thick for anyone to swallow
Not a good idea to come on too educated Juries dont
like people who study in Europe
Well you could easily loosen your tie and lapse into
a broad Southern accent
I could see myself coming on like plain folks in a
phony Southern accent I gave up trying to be one of the
boys twenty years ago I told him this sort of act wasnt in
my line at all and he never mentioned the idea again
Criminal law is one of the few professions where the
client buys someone elses luck The luck of most people is
strictly nontransferable But a good criminal lawyer can
sell all his luck to a client and the more luck he sells the
more he has to sell
I left New Orleans several days later and went to the
Rio Grande Valley The Rio Grande River runs into the
Gulf of Mexico at Brownsville Sixty miles up river from
Brownsville is the town of Mission The Valley runs from
Brownsville to Mission a strip of ground sixty miles long
and twenty miles wide The area is irrigated from the Rio
Grande River Before irrigation nothing grew here but
mesquite and cactus Now it is one of the richest farm
areas in the US
A threelane highway runs from Brownsville to Mission
and the towns of the Valley string out along this
highway There are no cities in the Valley and no country
The area is a vast suburb of flimsy houses The Valley is
flat as a table Nothing grows there but crops citrus and
palms brought from California A hot dry wind starts every
afternoon and blows until sundown The Valley is citrus
country Pink and red grapefruit grow there that will not
grow anywhere else Citrus country is realestatepromoted
country country of BideAWee tourist courts and old
people waiting around to die The whole Valley has the
impermanent look of a camp or carnival Soon the suckers
will all be dead and the pitchmen will go somewhere else
During the Twenties real estate operators brought
trainloads of prospects down to the Valley and let them
pick grapefruit right off the trees and eat it One of these
pioneer promoters is said to have constructed a large artificial
lake and sold plots all around it The lake will subirrigate
your groves As soon as the last sale closed he
turned off the water and disappeared with his lake leaving
the prospects sitting there in a desert
As put down by the realtor citrus is a flawless setup
for old people who want to retire and take life easy The
grove owner does nothing A citrus association cares for
the grove and markets the fruit and hands the owner a
check Actually citrus is a risky deal for the small investor
Over a period of time the average return is high especially
on the pink and ruby red fruit But a small operator cannot
ride out the years when the prices are low or the yield of
fruit small
A premonition of doom hangs over the Valley You
have to make it now before something happens before the
black fly ruins the citrus before support prices are taken
off the cotton before the flood the hurricane the freeze
the long dry spell when there is no water to irrigate before
the Border Patrol shuts off your wetbacks The threat of
disaster is always there persistent and disquieting as the
afternoon wind The Valley was desert and it will be desert
again Meanwhile you try to make yours while there is still
time
Old men sitting in real estate offices say Well this is
nothing new Ive seen all this before I remember back in
`28
But a new factor something that nobody has seen
before is changing the familiar aspect of disaster like the
slow beginnings of a disease so that no one can say just
when it began
Death is absence of life Wherever life withdraws
death and rot move in Whatever it is  orgones life force
 that we all have to score for all the time there is not
much of it in the Valley Your food rots before you can get
it home Milk sours before you can finish the meal The
Valley is a place where the new antilife force is breaking
through
Death hangs over the Valley like an invisible smog
The place exerts a curious magnetism on the moribund
The dying cell gravitates to the Valley
Gary West came from Minneapolis He had saved up
twenty thousand dollars from operating a dairy farm during
the War With this money he bought a house and grove
in the Valley The place was on the far side of Mission
where irrigation stops and the desert begins Five acres of
Ruby Reds and a house in 1920 Spanish style There he sat
with his mother his wife and two children In his eyes you
could see the baffled frightened resentful looks of a man
who feels the stirring in his cells of a fatal disease process
He was not sick at that time but his cells were looking for
death and West knew it He wanted to sell out and leave
the Valley
I feel closed in here You have to go so far to get out
of the Valley he would say
He began running from one project to another A
plantation in Mississippi a winter vegetable setup in Mexico
He went back to Minnesota and bought into a cowfeed
company He did this with the down payment on the
sale of his Valley property But he couldnt keep away
from the Valley He would run like a hooked fish until the
drag of his dying cells tired him out and the Valley reeled
him in He tried out various illnesses A throat infection
settled in his heart He lay in the McAllen Hospital and
tried to see himself as a man of business impatient to get
up and back to work His projects became more and more
preposterous
That man is crazy said Roy the real estate man
He dont know what he wants
Only the Valley was real to West now There was no
other place for him to go The other places were fantasy
Listening to him talk you got the uncanny feeling that
places like Milwaukee didnt exist West rallied and went to
look over a fifteendollarperacre sheepraising setup in
Arkansas He came back to the Valley and started building
a house on credit Something went wrong with his kidneys
and his body swelled up with urine You could smell urine
on his breath and through his skin This is uremic poisoning
exclaimed the doctor as the smell of urine filled the
room West went into convulsions and died He left his
wife a tangle of exchange notes between Milwaukee and
the Valley that she will be ten years unraveling
All the worst features of America have drained down
to the Valley and concentrated there In the whole area
there is not one good restaurant The food situation could
only be tolerated by people who do not taste what they eat
In the Valley restaurants are not operated by people who
are cookers and purveyors of food They are opened by
somebody who decides that people always eat so a restaurant
is a good deal His place will have a glass front
so people can see in and chromium fixtures The food is
bad US restaurant food So there he sits in his restaurant
and looks at his customers with puzzled resentful eyes He
didnt much want to run a restaurant anyway Now he isnt
even making money
A lot of people made quick easy money during the
War and for several years after Any business was good
just as any stock is good on a rising market People
thought they were sharp operators when actually they
were Just riding a lucky streak Now the Valley is in a
losing streak and only the big operators can ride it out In
the Valley economic laws work out like a formula in high
school algebra since there is no human element to interfere
The very rich are getting richer and all the others are
going broke The big holders are not shrewd or ruthless or
enterprising They dont have to say or think anything All
they have to do is sit and the money comes pouring in
You have to get up with the Big Holders or drop out and
take any job they hand you The middle class is getting the
squeeze and only one in a thousand will go up The Big
Holders are the house and the small farmers are the players
The player goes broke if he keeps on playing and the
farmer has to play or lose to the Government by default
The Big Holders own all the Valley banks and when the
farmer goes broke the bank takes over Soon the Big Holders
will own the Valley
The Valley is like an honest dice table where the
players do not have the vitality to influence the dice and
they win or lose by pure chance You never hear anyone
say It had to happen that way or when they do say it
they are talking about a death An event that had to
happen that way may be good or bad but there it is and
you cannot regret it or rehash it Since everything that
happens in the Valley  except death  happens by chance
the inhabitants are always tampering with the past like the
twodollar bettor on the return train from the track I
should have hung on to that hundred acres on the lower
lift; I should have took up them oil leases; I should have
planted cotton instead of tomatoes A nasal whine goes up
from the Valley a vast muttering of banal regret and despair
When I arrived in the Valley I was still in the postcure
drag I had no appetite and no energy All I wanted to
do was sleep and I slept twelve to fourteen hours a day
Occasionally I bought two ounces of paregoric drank it
with two goof balls and felt normal for several hours You
have to sign for PC when you buy it and I did not want
to bum down the drugstores You can only buy PG so
often or the druggist gets wise Then he packs in or ups
the price
I had gone into partnership with a friend named
Evans to buy machinery hire a farmer and raise a cotton
crop We had a hundred and fifty acres in cotton Good
cotton land will pick a bale to an acre and the US support
price guaranteed us a hundred and fifty dollars to a
bale So we stood to gross about $22000 The farmer did
all the actual work Evans and I would drive around every
few days to see how the cotton was looking It took us
about an hour to look at all our cotton because the fields
were scattered around from Edingburg to the lower lift
almost on the river There was no particular point in looking
at the cotton since neither of us knew the first thing
about it We just drove around to pass the time until five
pm when we started drinking
There were five or six regulars who gathered every
afternoon at Evans house Exactly at five someone would
bang a tin pan and yell Drinking time and the others
would jump up like fighters coming out at the bell We
made our own gin from Mexican alcohol as a measure of
economy Martinis mixed with this gin had a terrible taste
and you had to fill the cocktail with pieces of ice or it
would be warm before you could get it down I cannot
drink even good martinis in hot weather so I made myself
a long drink with sugar and lime and seltzer and a tiny
pinch of quinine to approximate gin and tonic No one in
the Valley had ever heard of quinine water
All that summer was perfect cotton weather Ilot and
dry day after day We started picking after the Fourth of
July and all our cotton was off by the September 1st deadline
We broke a little better than even High operating
costs and the high cost of living  I figured it was costing
me about seven hundred a month to live in that valley
without a maid or a car  took most of the profit I decided
it was time to pull out of the Valley
Early in October 1 got a letter from the bonding
company saying my case was coming up in four days I
called Tige and he said Pay no attention I will get a
continuance A few days later I got a letter from Tige
saying that he had scored for a threeweek continuance
but was doubtful of getting the trial put off again
I called him on the phone and told him I was taking a
trip to Mexico He said Fine You just have as good a
time as you can in three weeks and be back here for the
trial
I asked him how were the chances of another continuance
He said Frankly not good I cant do a thing with
this judge His ulcers are bothering him
I decided to take steps to remain in Mexico when I
got there
As soon as I hit Mexico City I started looking for
junk At least I always had one eye open for it As I said
before I can spot junk neighborhoods My first night in
town I walked down Dolores Street and saw a group of
Chinese junkies standing in front of an Exquisito Chop
Suey joint Chinamen are hard to make They will only do
business with another Chinaman So I knew it would be a
waste of time trying to score with these characters
One day I was walking down San Juan Létran and
passed a cafeteria that had colored tile set in the stucco
around the entrance and the floor was covered with the
same tile The cafeteria was unmistakably Near Eastern
As I walked by someone came out of the cafeteria He was
a type character you see only on the fringes of a junk
neighborhood
As the geologist looking for oil is guided by certain
outcroppings of rock so certain signs indicate the near
presence of junk Junk is often found adjacent to ambiguous
or transitional districts East Fourteenth near
Third in New York; Poydras and St Charles in New Orleans;
San Juan Létran in Mexico City Stores selling artificial
limbs wigmakers dental mechanics loft manufacturers
of perfumes pomades novelties essential oils A point
where dubious business enterprise touches Skid Row
There is a type person occasionally seen in these
neighborhoods who has connections with junk though he
is neither a user nor a seller But when you see him the
dowser wand twitches Junk is close His place of origin is
the Near East probably Egypt He has a large straight
nose His lips are thin and purpleblue like the lips of a
penis The skin is tight and smooth over his face He is
basically obscene beyond any possible vile act or practice
He has the mark of a certain trade or occupation that no
longer exists If junk were gone from the earth there might
still be junkies standing around in junk neighborhoods feeling
the lack vague and persistent a pale ghost of junk
sickness
So this man walks around in the places where he once
exercised his obsolete and unthinkable trade But he is
unperturbed His eyes are black with an insects unseeing
calm He looks as if he nourished himself on honey and
Levantine syrups that he sucks up through a sort of
proboscis
What is his lost trade Definitely of a servant class
and something to do with the dead though he is not an
embalmer Perhaps he stores something in his body  a
substance to prolong life  of which he is periodically
milked by his masters He is as specialized as an insect for
the performance of some inconceivably vile function
The Chimu Bar looks like any cantina from the outside
but as soon as you walk in you know you are in a
queer bar
I ordered a drink at the bar and looked around Three
Mexican fags were posturing in front of the jukebox One
of them slithered over to where I was standing with the
stylized gestures of a temple dancer and asked for a cigarette
There was something archaic in the stylized movements
a depraved animal grace at once beautiful and
repulsive 1 could see him moving in the light of campfires
the ambiguous gestures fading out into the dark Sodomy is
as old as the human species One of the fags was sitting in
a booth by the jukebox perfectly immobile with a stupid
animal serenity
I turned to get a closer look at the boy who had
moved over Now bad ¿Por qué triste I asked Why
sad Not much of a gambit but I wasnt there to converse
The boy smiled revealing very red gums and sharp
teeth far apart He shrugged and said something to the
effect that he wasnt sad or not especially so I looked
around the room
Vámonos a otro lugar I said Lets go some place
else
The boy nodded We walked down the street into an
allnight restaurant and sat down in a booth The boy
dropped his hand onto my leg under the table I felt my
stomach knot with excitement I gulped my coffee and
waited impatiently while the boy finished a beer and
smoked a cigarette
The boy knew a hotel I pushed five pesos through a
grill An old man unlocked the door of a room and
dropped a ragged towel on the chair ¿Llevas pistola
You carry a pistol  asked the boy He had caught
sight of my gun I said yes
I folded my pants and dropped them over a chair
placing the pistol on my pants I dropped my shirt and
shorts on the pistol I sat down naked on the edge of the
bed and watched the boy undress He folded his worn blue
suit carefully He took off his shirt and placed it around his
coat on the back of a chair His skin was smooth and
coppercolored The boy stepped out of his shorts and
turned around and smiled at me Then he came and sat
beside me on the bed I ran one hand slowly over the boys
back following with the other hand the curve of the chest
down over the fiat brown stomach The boy smiled and lay
down on the bed
Later we smoked a cigarette our shoulders touching
under the cover The boy said he had to go We both
dressed I wondered if he expected money I decided not
Outside we separated at a corner shaking hands
Some time later I ran into a boy named Angelo in the
same bar I saw Angelo off and on for two years When I
was on junk I wouldnt meet Angelo for months but when
I got off I always ran into him on the street somewhere In
Mexico your wishes have a dream power When you want
to see someone he turns up
Once I had been looking for a boy and I was tired and
sat down on a stone bench in the Alameda I could feel the
smooth stone through my pants and the ache in my loins
like a toothache when the pain is light and different from
any other pain Sitting there looking across the park I
suddenly felt calm and happy seeing myself in a dream
relationship with The City and knew I was going to score
for a boy that night I did
Angelos face was Oriental Japaneselooking except
for his copper skin He was not queer and I gave him
money; always the same amount twenty pesos Sometimes
I didnt have that much and he would say No importa
 it does not matter He insisted on sweeping the apartment
out whenever he spent the night there
Once I connected with Angelo I did not go back to
the Chimu Mexico or Stateside queer bars brought me
down
The meaning of mañana is Wait until the signs are
right If you are in a hurry to score for junk and go
around cracking to strangers you will get beat for your
money and likely have trouble with the law But if you
wait junk will come to you if you want it
I had been in Mexico City several months One day I
went to see the lawyer I had hired to get working and
residence papers for me A shabby middleaged man was
standing in front of the office
He aint come yet the man said I looked at the
man He was an oldtime junky no doubt about it And I
knew he didnt have any doubts about me either
We stood around talking until the lawyer came The
junky was there to sell some religious medals The lawyer
had told him to bring a dozen up to his office
After I had seen the lawyer I asked the junky if he
would join me for supper and we went to a restaurant on
San Juan Létran
The junky asked me what my story was and I told
him He flipped back his coat lapel and showed me a spike
stuck in the underside of the lapel
Ive been on junk for twentyeight years he said
Do you want to score
There is only one pusher in Mexico City and that is
Lupita She has been in the business twenty years Lupita
got her start with one gram of junk and built up from there
to a monopoly of the junk business in Mexico City She
weighed three hundred pounds so she started using junk
to reduce but only her face got thin and the result is no
improvement Every month or so she hires a new lover
gives him shirts and suits and wrist watches and then
packs him in when she has enough
Lupita pays off to operate wide open as if she was
running a grocery store She doesnt have to worry about
stool pigeons because every law in the Federal District
knows that Lupita sells junk She keeps outfits in glasses of
alcohol so the junkies can fix in the joint and walk out
clean Whenever a law needs money for a quick beer he
goes over by Lupita and waits for someone to walk out on
the chance he may be holding a paper For ten pesos
$125 the cop lets him go For twenty pesos he gets his
junk back Now and then some illadvised citizen starts
pushing better papers for less money but he doesnt push
long Lupita has a standing offer ten free papers to anybody
who tells her about another pusher in the Federal
District Then Lupita calls one of her friends on the narcotics
squad and the pusher is busted
Lupita fences on the side If anyone makes a good
score she puts out a grapevine to find out who was in on
the job Thieves sell to her at her price or she tips the law
Lupita knows everything that happens in the lowerbracket
underworld of Mexico City She sits there doling out papers
like an Aztec goddess
Lupita sells her stuff in papers It is supposed to be
heroin Actually it is pantopon cut with milk sugar and
some other crap that looks like sand and remains undissolved
in the spoon after you cook up
I started scoring for Lupitas papers through Ike the
oldtime junky I met in the lawyers office I had been off
junk three months at this time It took me just three days
to get back on
An addict may be ten years off the junk but he can
get a new habit in less than a week; whereas someone who
has never been addicted would have to take two shots a
day for two months to get any habit at all I took a shot
daily for four months before I could notice withdrawal
symptoms You can list the symptoms of junk sickness but
the feel of it is like no other feeling and you can not put it
into words I did not experience this junk sick feeling until
my second habit
Why does an addict get a new habit so much quicker
than a junk virgin even after the addict has been clean for
years I do not accept the theory that junk is lurking in the
body all that time  the spine is where it supposedly holes
up  and I disagree with all psychological answers I think
the use of junk causes permanent cellular alteration Once
a junky always a junky You can stop using junk but you
are never off after the first habit
When my wife saw I was getting the habit again she
did something she had never done before I was cooking up
a shot two days after Id connected with Old Ike My wife
grabbed the spoon and threw the junk on the floor I
slapped her twice across the face and she threw herself on
the bed sobbing then turned around and said to me
Dont you want to do anything at all You know how
bored you get when you have a habit Its like all the lights
went out Oh well do what you want I guess you have
some stashed anyway
I did have some stashed
Lupitas papers cost fifteen pesos each  about two
dollars They are half the strength of a twodollar Stateside
cap If you have any habit at all it takes two papers to fix
you and I mean just fix To get really loaded you would
need four papers I thought this was an outrageous price
considering everything is cheaper in Mexico and I was
expecting bargain prices on junk And here I was paying
aboveUS prices for junk of lower quality Ike told me
She has to charge high because she pays off to the law
So I asked Ike What about scripts
He told me the croakers could only prescribe M in
solution The most they were allowed to prescribe in one
script was fifteen centogramos or about two and a half
grains I figured it would work out a lot cheaper than
Lupita so we started hitting the croakers We located several
who would write the script for five pesos and five
more who would get it filled
One script will last a day if you keep the habit down
The trouble is scripts are easier to get than to fill and
when you do find a drugstore that will fill the script like as
not the druggist steals all the junk and gives you distilled
water Or he doesnt have any M and puts anything on the
shelf in the bottle I have cashed scripts that came back full
of undissolved powder I could have killed myself trying to
shoot this crap
Mexican croakers are not like Stateside croakers
They never pull that professional man act on you A
croaker who will write at all will write without hearing a
story In Mexico City there are so many doctors that a lot
of them have a hard time making it I know croakers who
would starve to death if they didnt write morphine scripts
They dont have patient one unless you call junkies patients
I was keeping up Ikes habit as well as my own and it
ran into money
I asked Ike what the score was on pushing in Mexico
City He said it was impossible
You wouldnt last a week Sure you can get plenty
customers that would pay you fifteen pesos for a shot of
good M like we get with the scripts But first time they
wake up sick with no money they go right to Lupita and
tell her for a few papers Or if the law grabs them they
open their mouth right away Some of them dont even
have to be asked Right away they say `Turn me loose and
Ill tell you somebody pushing junk So the law sends them
up to make a buy with the marked money and thats it
Youre fucked right there Its eight years for selling this
stuff and theres no bail
I have `em come to me `Ike we know you get stuff
on the scripts Heres fifty pesos Get me one script Sometimes
they got good watches or a suit of clothes I tell `em
Im off Sure I could make two hundred pesos a day but I
wouldnt last a week
But cant you find like five or six good customers
I know every hip in Mexico City And I wouldnt
trust one of `em Not one
At first we filled the scripts without too much trouble
But after a few weeks the scripts had piled up in the
drugstores that would fill M scripts and they began packing
in It looked like we would be back with Lupita Once or
twice we got caught short and had to score with Lupita
Using that good drugstore M had run up our habits and it
took two of Lupitas fifteenpeso papers to fix us Now
thirty pesos in one shot was a lot more than I could afford
to pay I had to quit cut down to where I could make it on
two of Lupitas papers per day or find another source of
supply
One of the scriptwriting doctors suggested to Ike that
he apply for a government permit Ike explained to me that
the Mexican government issued permits to hips allowing
them a definite quantity of morphine per month at wholesale
prices The doctor would put in an application for Ike
for one hundred pesos I said Go ahead and apply and
gave him the money I did not expect the deal to go
through but it did Ten days later he had a government
permit to buy fifteen grams of morphine every month The
permit had to be signed by his doctor and the head doctor
at the Board of Health Then he would take it to a drugstore
and have it filled
The price was about two dollars per gram I remember
the first time he filled the permit A whole boxful of
cubes of morphine Like a junkies dream I had never seen
so much morphine before all at once I put out the money
and we split the stuff Seven grams per month allowed me
about three grains per day which was more than I ever
had in the States So I was supplied with plenty of junk for
a cost of thirty dollars a month as compared with about
three hundred a month in the US
During this time I did not get acquainted with the
other junkies in Mexico City Most of them make their
junk money by stealing They are always hot They are all
pigeons Not one of them can be trusted with the price of a
paper No good can come from associating with these
characters
Ike didnt steal He made out selling bracelets and
medals that looked like silver He had to keep ahead of his
customers because this phony silver turned black in a matter
of hours Once or twice he was arrested and charged
with fraud but I always bought him out I told him to find
some routine that was strictly legitimate and he started
selling crucifixes
Ike had been a booster in the States and claimed to
have scored for a hundred dollars a day in Chicago with a
spring suitcase hed shoved suits into The side of the suitcase
would spring back into place All the money went for
coke and M
But Ike would not steal in Mexico He said even the
best thieves spend most of their time in the joint In Mexico
known thieves can be sent to the Tres Marias penal
colony without trial There are no middleclass whitecollar
thieves who make good livings like you find in the
States There are big operators with political connections
and there are bums who spend half their time in jail The
big operators are usually police chiefs or other high officials
That is the setup in Mexico and Ike did not have
connections to operate
One junky I did see from time to time was a darkskinned
Yucatecan whom Ike referred to as the Black
Bastard The Black Bastard worked the crucifix routine
He was in fact extremely religious and made the pilgrimage
to Chalma every year going the last quarter mile
on his knees over rocks with two people holding him up
After that he was fixed for a year
Our Lady of Chalma seems to be the patron saint of
junkies and cheap thieves because all Lupitas customers
make the pilgrimage once a year The Black Bastard rents
a cubicle in the church and pushes papers of junk outrageously
cut with milk sugar
I used to see the Black Bastard around from time to
time and I heard a great deal about him from Ike Ike
hated the Black Bastard only as one junky can hate another
The Black Bastard burned down that drugstore
Going up there saying I sent him Now the druggest wont
fill no more scripts
So I drifted along from month to month We were
always a little short at the end of the month and had to fill
a few scripts I always had an insecure feeling when I was
out of stuff and a comfortable feeling of security when I
had those seven gramos stashed safely away
Once Ike got fifteen days in the city prison  the Carmen
they call it  for vagrancy I was short and could not
pay the fine and it was three days before I got in to see
him His body had shrunk; all the bones stuck out in his
face; his brown eyes were bright with pain I had a piece of
hop covered with cellophane in my mouth I spit the hop
on half an orange and handed it to Ike In twenty minutes
he was loaded
I looked around and noticed how the hips stood out as
a special group like the fags who were posturing and
screeching in one corner of the yard The junkies were
grouped together talking and passing the junky gesture
back and forth
Junkies all wear hats if they have hats They all look
alike as if wearing a costume identical in some curious
way that escapes exact tabulation Junk has marked them
all with its indelible brand
Ike told me that the prisoners often steal the pants off
a newcomer Such a lousy people they got in here I did
see several men walking around in their underwear The
Commandante would catch wives and relatives bringing
junk to the prisoners and shake them down for all they
had
He caught one woman bringing a paper to her husband
but she only had five pesos So he took her dress and
sold it for fifteen pesos and she went home wrapped in an
old lousy sheet
The place was crawling with pigeons Ike was afraid
to hold any of the hap I brought him for fear the other
prisoners would take it or turn him over to the Commandante
I fell into a routine of staying home with three or four
shots a day For something to do I enrolled in Mexico
City College The students impressed me as a sorrylooking
lot but then I wasnt looking at them very hard
When you look back over a year on the junk it seems
like no time at all Only the periods when you were sick
stand out You remember the first few shots of a habit and
the shots when you were really sick
Even in Mexico there is always the day when everything
goes wrong The drugstore is closed or your boy is
off duty the croaker is out of town at some fiesta and you
cant score
The end of the month I was out of junk and sick
Waiting for Old Ike to show with a morphine script A
junky spends half his life waiting There was a cat in the
house which we had been feeding an uglylooking gray
cat 1 picked the animal up and held it on my lap petting
it When it tried to jump down I tightened my hold The
cat began to mew looking for a way to escape
I brought my face down to touch the cats cold nose
with mine and the cat scratched at my face It was a halfassed
scratch and didnt even land But it was all I needed
I held the cat out at arms length slapping it back and
forth across the face with my free hand The cat screamed
and clawed me then started spraying piss all over my
pants I went on hitting the cat my hands bloody from
scratches The animal twisted loose and ran into the closet
where I could hear it groaning and whimpering with terror
Now Ill finish the bastard off I said picking up a
heavy painted cane Sweat was running down my face I
was trembling with excitement I licked my lips and started
toward the closet alert to block any escape attempt
At this point my old lady intervened and I put down
the cane The cat scrambled out of the closet and ran down
the stairs
Ike brought me cocaine when he could score for it C
is hard to find in Mexico I had never used any good coke
before Coke is pure kick It lifts you straight up a mechanical
lift that starts leaving you as soon as you feel it I
dont know anything like C for a lift but the lift only lasts
ten minutes or so Then you want another shot When you
are shooting C you shoot more M to level the C kick and
smooth out the rough edges Without M C makes you too
nervous and M is an antidote for an overdose There is no
tolerance with C and not much margin between a regular
and a toxic dose Several times I got too much and everything
went black and my heart began turning over Luckily
I always had plenty of M on hand and a shot of M fixed
me right up
Junk is a biological necessity when you have a habit
an invisible mouth When you take a shot of junk you are
satisfied just like you ate a big meal But using C you want
another shot as soon as the effect wears off If you have C
in the house you will not go out to a movie or go out at all
until the C is all gone One shot creates an urgent desire
for another shot to maintain the high But once the C is
out of your system you forget all about it There is no
habit to C
Junk shortcircuits sex The drive to nonsexual sociability
comes from the same place sex comes from so
when I have an H or M shooting habit I am nonsociable
If someone wants to talk OK But there is no drive to get
acquainted When I come off the junk I often run through
a period of uncontrolled sociability and talk to anyone who
will listen
Junk takes everything and gives nothing but insurance
against junk sickness Every now and then I took a good
look at the deal I was giving myself and decided to take the
cure When you are getting plenty of junk kicking looks
easy You say Im not getting any kick from the shots
any more I might as well quit But when you cut down
into junk sickness the picture looks different
During the year or so I was on the junk in Mexico I
started the cure five times I tried reducing the shots I tried
the Chinese cure but nothing worked
After my Chinese fiasco I made up some papers and
gave them to my wife to hide and dole out according to a
schedule I had Ike help me make up the papers but he
had an inaccurate mind and his schedule was all topheavy
on the beginning and suddenly ended with no reduction So
I made up my own schedule For a while I stayed with the
schedule but I didnt have any real push I got stuff from
Ike on the side and made excuses for the extra shots
I knew that I did not want to go on taking junk If I
could have made a single decision I would have decided
no more junk ever But when it came to the process of
quitting I did not have the drive It gave me a terrible
feeling of helplessness to watch myself break every schedule
I set up as though I did not have control over my
actions
One morning in April I woke up a little sick I lay
there looking at shadows on the white plaster ceiling I
remembered a long time ago when I lay in bed beside my
mother watching lights from the street move across the
ceiling and down the walls I felt the sharp nostalgia of
train whistles piano music down a city street burning
leaves
A mild degree of junk sickness always brought me the
magic of childhood It never fails I thought Just like a
shot I wonder if all junkies score for this wonderful stuff
I went into the bathroom to take a shot I was a long
time hitting a vein The needle clogged twice Blood ran
down my arm The junk spread through my body an injection
of death The dream was gone I looked down at the
blood that ran from elbow to wrist I felt a sudden pity for
the violated veins and tissue Tenderly I wiped the blood
off my arm
Im going to quit I said aloud
I made up a solution of hop and told Ike to stay away
for a few days He said I hope you make it kid I hope
you get off May I fall down and be paralyzed if I dont
mean it
In fortyeight hours the backlog of morphine in my
body ran out The solution barely cut the sickness I drank
it all with two nembutals and slept several hours When I
woke up my clothes were soaked through with sweat My
eyes were watering and smarting My whole body felt itchy
and irritable I twisted about on the bed arching my back
and stretching my arms and legs I drew my knees up my
hands clasped between the thighs The pressure of my
hands set off the hair trigger orgasm of junk sickness I got
up and changed my underwear
There was a little hop left in the bottle I drank that
went out and bought four tubes of codeine tablets I took
the codeine with hot tea and felt better
Ike told me Youre taking it too fast Let me mix up
a solution for you I could hear him out in the kitchen
crooning over the mixture A little cinnamon in case he
starts to puke   a little sage for the shits  some cloves
to clean the blood
I never tasted anything so awful but the mixture leveled
off my sickness at a bearable point so I felt a little
high all the time I wasnt high on the hop; I was high on
withdrawal toneup Junk is an inoculation of death that
keeps the body in a condition of emergency When the
junky is cut off emergency reactions continue Sensations
sharpen the addict is aware of his visceral processes to an
uncomfortable degree peristalsis and secretion go unchecked
No matter what his actual age the kicking addict
is liable to the emotional excesses of a child or an adolescent
About the third day of using Ikes mixture I started
drinking I had never been able to drink before when I was
on the junk or junk sick But eating hop is different from
shooting the white stuff You can mix hop and lush
At first I started drinking at five in the afternoon
After a week l started drinking at eight in the morning
stayed drunk all day and all night and woke up drunk the
next morning
Every morning when I woke up I washed down
benzedrine sanicin and a piece of hop with black coffee
and a shot of tequila Then I lay back and closed my eyes
and tried to piece together the night before and yesterday
Often I drew a blank from noon on You sometimes wake
up from a dream and think Thank God I didnt really do
that Reconstructing a period of blackout you think My
God did I really do it The line between saying and
thinking is blurred Did you say it or just think it
After ten days of the cure I had deteriorated shockingly
My clothes were spotted and stiff from the drinks I
had spilled all over myself I never bathed I had lost
weight my hands shook I was always spilling things
knocking over chairs and falling down But I seemed to
have unlimited energy and a capacity for liquor I never
had before My emotions spilled out everywhere I was
uncontrollably sociable and would talk to anybody I could
pin down I forced distastefully intimate confidences on
perfect strangers Several times I made the crudest sexual
propositions to people who had given no hint of reciprocity
Ike was around every few days Im glad to see you
getting off Bill May I fall down and be paralyzed if I
dont mean it But if you get too sick and start to puke
heres five centogramos of M
Ike took a severe view of my drinking Youre drinking
Bill Youre drinking and getting crazy You look terrible
You look terrible in your face Better you should go
back to stuff than drink like this
I was in a cheap cantina off Dolores Street Mexico
City I had been drinking for about two weeks I was
sitting in a booth with three Mexicans drinking tequila
The Mexicans were fairly well dressed One of them spoke
English A middleaged heavyset Mexican with a sad
sweet face sang songs and played the guitar He was sitting
at the end of a booth in a chair I was glad the singing
made conversation impossible
Five cops came in I figured I might get a shake so I
slipped the gun and holster out of my belt and dropped
them under the table with a piece of hop I had stashed in a
cigarette package The cops had a quick beer and took
off
When I reached under the table my gun was gone but
the holster was there
I was sitting in another bar with the Mexican who
spoke English The singer and the other two Mexicans
were gone The place was suffused with a dim yellow light
A moldylooking bullhead mounted on a plaque hung over
the mahogany bar Pictures of bullfighters some autographed
decorated the walls The word saloon was
etched in the frostedglass swinging door I found myself
reading the word saloon over and over I had the feeling
of coming into the middle of a conversation
I inferred from the expression of the other man that I
was in midsentence but did not know what I had said or
what I was going to say or what the discussion was about
I thought we must be talking about the gun I am probably
trying to buy it back I noticed the man had the piece
of hop in his hand and was turning it over
So you think I look like a junky he said
I looked at him The man had a thin face with high
cheekbones The eyes were a graybrown color often seen
in mixed Indian and European stock He was wearing a
light gray suit and a tie His mouth was thin twisted down
at the corners A junky mouth for sure There are people
who look like junkies and arent just as some people look
queer and arent Its a type that causes trouble
Im going to call a cop he said starting for a phone
attached to a support pillar
I jerked the telephone out of the mans hand and
pushed him against the bar so hard he bounced off it The
man smiled at me His teeth were covered with a brown
film He turned his back and called the bartender over and
showed him the piece of hop I walked out and got a
cab
I remember going back to my apartment to get another
gun  a heavycaliber revolver I was in a hysterical
rage though exactly why I cannot in retrospect understand
I got out of a taxi and walked down the street and
into the bar The man was leaning against the bar his gray
coat pulled tight over his thin back and shoulders He
turned an expressionless face to me
I said Walk outside ahead of me
Why Bill he asked
Go on walk
I flipped the heavy revolver out of my waistband
cocking it as I drew and stuck the muzzle in the mans
stomach With my left hand I took hold of the mans coat
lapel and shoved him back against the bar It did not occur
to me until later that the man had used my correct first
name and that the bartender probably knew it too
The man was perfectly relaxed his face blank with
controlled fear I saw someone approaching from behind
on my right side and half turned my head The bartender
was closing in with a cop I turned around irritated at the
interruption I shoved the gun in the cops stomach
Who asked you to put in your two cents I asked in
English I was not talking to a solid threedimensional cop
I was talking to the recurrent cop of my dreams  an irritating
nondescript darkish man who would rush in when
I was about to take a shot or go to bed with a boy
The bartender grabbed my arm twisting it to one side
out of the cops stomach The cop stolidly hauled out his
battered 45 automatic placing it firmly against my body I
could feel the coldness of the muzzle through my thin
cotton shirt The cops stomach stuck out He had not
sucked it in or leaned forward I relaxed my hold on the
gun and felt it leave my hand I halfraised my hands palm
out in a gesture of surrender
All right all right I said and then added bueno
The cop put away his 45 The bartender was leaning
against the bar examining the gun The man in the gray
Suit stood there without any expression at all
Esta cargado   Its loaded  said the bartender
without looking up from the gun
I intended to say Of course  what good is an unloaded
gun but I did not say anything The scene was
unreal and flat and pointless as though I had forced my
way into someone elses dream the drunk wandering out
onto the stage
And I was unreal to the others the stranger from
another country The bartender looked at me with curiosity
He gave a little shrug of puzzled disgust and slipped the
gun into his waistband There was no hate in the room
Perhaps they would have hated me if I had been closer to
them
The cop took me firmly by the arm Vámonos
gringo he said
I walked out with the cop I felt limp and had difficulty
controlling my legs Once I stumbled and the cop
steadied me I was trying to convey the idea that while I
had no money on my person I could borrow some de
amigos My brain was numb I mixed Spanish and English
and the word for borrow was hidden in some filing
cabinet of the mind cut off from my use by the mechanical
barrier of alcoholnumbed connections The cop shook his
head I was making an effort to reform the concept Suddenly
the cop stopped walking
Andale gringo he said giving me a slight push on
the shoulder The cop stood there for a minute watching
me as I walked on down the street I waved The cop did
not respond He turned and walked back the way he had
come
I had one peso left I walked into a cantina and ordered
a beer There was no draft beer and bottle beer cost
a peso There was a group of young Mexicans at the end of
the bar and I got to talking to them One of them showed
me a Secret Service badge Probably a phony I decided
Theres a phony cop in every Mexican bar I found myself
drinking a tequila The last thing I remembered was the
sharp taste of the lemon I sucked with the glass of tequila
I woke up next morning in a strange room I looked
around Cheap joint Five pesos A wardrobe a chair a
table I could see people passing outside through the
drawn curtains Ground floor Some of my clothes were
heaped on the chair My coat and shirt lay on the table
I swung my legs Out of the bed and sat there trying to
remember what happened after that last glass of tequila I
drew a blank I got out of bed and took inventory of my
effects Fountain pen gone It leaked anyway    never
had one that didnt pocketknife gone  no loss either
 I began putting on my clothes I had the shakes bad
Need a few quick beers   maybe I can catch Rollins
home now
It was a long walk Rollins was in front of his apartment
walking his Norwegian elkhound He was a solidly
built man of my age with strong handsome features and
wiry black hair a little gray at the temples He was wearing
an expensive sports coat whipcord slacks and a suede
leather jacket We had known each other for thirty years
Rollins listened to my account of the previous evening
Youre going to get your head blown off carrying
that gun he said What do you carry it for You
wouldnt know what you were shooting at You bumped
into trees twice there on Insurgentes You walked right in
front of a car I pulled you back and you threatened me I
left you there to find your own way home and I dont
know how you ever made it Everyone is fed up with the
way youve been acting lately If theres one thing I dont
want to be around and I think no one else particularly
wants to be around its a drunk with a gun
Youre right of course I said
Well I want to help you in any way I can But the
first thing you have to do is cut down on the sauce and
build up yourhealth You look terrible Then youd better
think about making some money Speaking of money I
guess youre broke as usual Rollins took out his wallet
Heres fifty pesos Thats the best I can do for you
I got drunk on the fifty pesos About nine that night I
ran out of money and went back to my apartment I lay
down and tried to sleep When I closed my eyes I saw an
Oriental face the lips and nose eaten away by disease The
disease spread melting the face into an amoeboid mass in
which the eyes floated dull crustacean eyes Slowly a new
face formed around the eyes A series of faces hieroglyphs
distorted and leading to the final place where the
human road ends where the human form can no longer
contain the crustacean horror that has grown inside it
I watched curiously I got the horrors I thought
matter of factly
I woke up with a start of fear I lay there my heart
beating fast trying to find out what had scared me I
thought I heard a slight noise downstairs There is someone
in the apartment I said aloud and immediately I
knew that there was
I took my 3030 carbine out of the closet My hands
were shaking; I could barely load the rifle I dropped several
cartridges on the floor before I got two in the loading
slot My legs kept folding under me I went downstairs and
turned on all the lights Nobody Nothing
I had the shakes bad and on top of that I was junk
sick How long since Ive had a shot I asked myself I
couldnt remember I began ransacking the apartment for
junk Some time before I had stashed a piece of hop in a
hole in one corner of the room The hop had slid under the
floorboards out of reach I had made several abortive attempts
to recover it
Ill get it this time I said grimly With shaking
hands I made a hook out of a coathanger and began
fishing for the hop The sweat ran down my nose I
skinned my hands on the jagged wood edges of the hole
If I cant get to it one way I will another I said grimly
and began looking for the saw
I couldnt find it I rushed from one room to the
other throwing things around and emptying drawers on
the floor in a mounting frenzy Sobbing with rage I tried
to rip the boards up with my hands Finally I gave up and
lay on the floor panting and whimpering
I remembered there was some dionin in the medicine
chest I got up to look Only one tablet left The tablet
cooked up milky and I was afraid to shoot it in the vein A
sudden involuntary jerk of my hand pulled the needle out
of my arm and the shot sprayed over my skin I sat there
looking at my arm
I finally slept a little and woke up next morning with a
terrific alcohol depression Junk sickness suspended by
codeine and hop numbed by weeks of constant drinking
came back on me full force I have to have some codeine
I thought
I looked through my clothes Nothing not a cigarette
not a centavo I went into the living room and reached into
the sofa where the sofa back joined the seat I ran my
hand along it A comb a piece of chalk a broken pencil
one tencentavo piece one five I felt a sickening shock of
pain and pulled my hand out I was bleeding from a deep
cut in my finger A razor blade evidently I tore off a piece
of towel and wrapped it around my finger The blood
soaked through and dripped on the floor I went back to
bed I couldnt sleep I couldnt read I lay there looking at
the ceiling stoically
A matchbox sailed past the door into the bathroom I
sat up my heart pounding Old Ike the pusher Ike
often sneaked into the house and manifested his presence
like a poltergeist throwing something or knocking on the
walls Old Ike appeared in the doorway
How you getting along he asked
Not so good I got the shakes I need a shot
Ike nodded Yeah he began M is the thing for the
shakes I remember once in Minneapolis
Never mind Minneapolis Have you got any
I got it but not with me Take me about twenty
minutes to get it Old Ike was sitting down leafing
through a magazine He looked up Why You want
some
Yes
Ill get it right away Ike was gone two hours
I had to wait for the guy to get back from lunch to
open the safe in the hotel I keep my stuff in the safe so
nobody makes me for it I tell `em at the hotel its gold dust
I use
But you got it
Yes I got it Where is your works
In the bathroom
Ike came back from the bathroom with the works and
began cooking up a shot He kept talking Youre drinking
and youre getting crazy I hate to see you get off this stuff
and on something worse I know so many that quit the
junk A lot of them cant make it with Lupita Fifteen
pesos for a paper and it takes three to fix you Right away
they start drinking and they dont last more than two or
three years
Lets have that shot I said
Yes Just a minute The needle is stopped Ike began
feeling along the edge of his coat lapel looking for a
horsehair to clean out the needle He went on talking I
remember once out by Mary Island We was on the boat
and the Colonel got drunk and fell in the water and come
near drowning with his two pistolas We had a hell of a
time to get him out Ike blew through the needle Clear
now I see a guy used to be a hip down by Lupitas They
called him El Sombrero because he makes it grabbing peoples
hats and running Comes up by a streetcar just when
it starts Reaches in and grabs a hat and  pfut  hes gone
You should see him now His legs all swelled up and covered
with sores and dirty oh my God The people walk
around him like this Ike was standing with the dropper in
one hand and the needle in the other
I said How about that shot
OK How much you want About five Centogramos
Better make it five
The shot was a long time taking effect It hit Slowly at
first then with mounting force I lay back on the bed like I
was in a warm bath
I kept on drinking Several days later I passed out in
the Ship Ahoy after drinking tequila for eight hours steadily
Some friends carried me home Next morning I had the
worst hangover of my life I began vomiting at tenminute
intervals until I brought up green bile
Then Old Ike was around You got to quit drinking
Bill Youre getting crazy
I had never been so sick Nausea wracked my body
like a convulsion Old Ike was holding me up as I vomited
a few spoonfuls of bile into the toilet He put an arm
around my shoulder and hugged me and helped me back to
bed About five in the afternoon I stopped vomiting and
managed to keep a bottle of grape juice and a glass of milk
down
It stinks like piss in here I said One of them cats
must have pissed under the bed
Ike began sniffing around the bed No nothing
there He sniffed some more near the head of the bed
where I was lying propped up on pillows Bill its you
smells like piss
Huh I began smelling my hands with mounting
horror as if I was discovering leprosy Good Lord I said
my stomach cold with fear I got uremic poisoning Ike
go out and get me a croaker
0K Bill Ill get you one right away
And dont come back with one of them fivepeso
scriptwriting bums
OK Bill
I lay there trying to control the fear I did not know
much about uremic poisoning A woman Id known
slightly in Texas had died of it after drinking a bottle of
beer every hour night and day for two weeks Rollins had
told me about it She swelled up and turned sorta black
and went into convulsions and died The whole house
smelled like piss
I relaxed trying to tune in on my viscera and find out
what the score was I did not feel death or indication of
grave illness I felt tired battered languid I lay there with
my eyes closed in the darkening room
Old Ike came in with a doctor and turned on the light
A Chinese doctor  one of Ikes scriptwriters He said
there was no uremia since I could piss and did not have a
headache
I asked How come I stink like this
The doctor shrugged Ike said He says its nothing
serious He says you have to stop drinking He says better
you go back to the other than drink like this The doctor
nodded I could hear Ike out in the hail hitting the croaker
for a morphine script
Ike I dont think that doctor knows a thing I want
you to do this Co to my friend Rollins  Ill write down
his address  and ask him to send me over a good doctor
He will know because his wife has been sick
Well all right said Ike But I think youre wasting
your money This doctor is pretty good
Yeah hes got a good writing arm
Ike laughed and shrugged All right
He was back in an hour with Rollins and another
doctor When they walked into the apartment the doctor
sniffed and smiled and turning to Rollins nodded He had
a round smiling Oriental face He made a quick examination
and asked if I could urinate Then turning to Ike he
asked if I was subject to fits
Ike told me He ask if you are ever crazy I tell him
no you just play with the cat some time
Rollins spoke in his halting Spanish looking for each
word Esto señor huele muy malo and quiere saber por
que This man smells very bad and he wants to know
why
The doctor explained it was an incipient uremia but
the danger was now past I would have to stop drinking for
a month The doctor picked up an empty tequila bottle
One more of these and you were dead He was putting
away his instruments He wrote out a prescription for an
antiacid preparation to take every few hours shook hands
with me and Ike and left
Next day I had the chucks and ate everything in sight
I stayed in bed three days The metabolic setup of alcoholism
had ceased operating When I started drinking again I
drank normally and never before the late afternoon I
stayed off the junk
At that time the GI students patronized Lolas during
the daytime and the Ship Ahoy at night Lolas was not
exactly a bar It was a small beer and soda joint There was
a boxful of beer and soda and ice at the left of the door as
you came in A counter with tube metal stools covered in
yellow glazed leather ran down one side of the room as far
as the jukebox Tables were lined along the wall opposite
the counter The stools had long since lost the rubber caps
for the legs and made a horrible screeching noise when the
maid pushed them around to sweep There was a kitchen in
back where a slovenly cook fried everything in rancid fat
There was neither past nor future in Lolas The place was
a waiting room
I was sitting in Lolas reading the papers After a
while I put the paper down and looked around At the next
table somebody was talking about lobotomy They sever
the nerves At another table two young men were trying
to make time with some Mexican girls Mi amigo es muy
muy   He was looking for a word The girls giggled
The conversations had a nightmare flatness talking dice
spilled in the tube metal chairs human aggregates dis
integrating in cosmic insanity random events in a dying
universe
I had been off junk two months When you quit junk
everything seems flat but you remember the shot schedule
the static honor of junk your life draining into your arm
three times a day
I picked up a comic section from the next table It
was two days old I put it down Nothing to do No place
to go My wife was in Acapulco I started back to my
apartment and spotted Old Ike a block away
Some people you can spot as far as you can see;
others you cant be sure of until you are close enough to
touch them Junkies are mostly in sharp focus There had
been a time when my blood pressure rose with pleasure at
the sight of Old Ike When you are on the junk the pusher
is like the loved one to the lover You wait for his special
step in the hail his special knock you scan the approaching
faces on a city street You can hallucinate every detail
of his appearance as though he were standing there in the
doorway going into the old pusher joke Sorry to disappoint
you but I couldnt score Watching the play of hope
and anxiety on the others face savoring the feel of benevolent
power the power to give or withhold Pat in New
Orleans always pulled that routine Bill Gains in New
York Old Ike would swear he didnt have anything then
slip the paper in my pocket and say Look you had some
all the time
But I was off the junk now Still a shot of morphine
would be nice later when I was ready to sleep or better a
speedball half cocaine half morphine I overtook Ike at
the door of the apartment I dropped a hand on his shoulder
and he turned his toothless oldwoman junky face
breaking into a smile as he recognized me
Hello he said
Havent seen you in a dogs age I said Where you
been
He laughed was in the can he said Anyway I
didnt want to come around because I knew you was off
You off completely
Yeah Im off
You wouldnt want a shot then Old Ike was smiling
Well    I felt a touch of the old excitement like
meeting someone you used to go to bed with and suddenly
the excitement is there and you both know that you are
going to go to bed again
Ike made a deprecatory gesture I got about ten
centogramos here Not enough to do me any good Cot a
little coke too
Come on in I said
I opened the door The apartment was dark and
musty Clothes books newspapers dirty plates and glasses
were scattered around on chairs and tables and on the dirty
floor I pushed a stack of magazines off a rattylooking
couch
Sit down I said You got the stuff on you
Yeah I got it planted He opened his fly and extracted
a rectangular paper packet  the junky fold with
one end fitting into another Inside the packet were two
smaller packets each similarly folded He placed the papers
on the table He watched me with his bright brown
eyes His mouth toothless and tightly closed gave the impression
of being sewed together
I went into the bathroom to get my works Needle
dropper and a piece of cotton I fished a teaspoon out of a
pile of dirty dishes in the kitchen sink Ole Ike tore a long
strip of paper and wet it with his mouth and wrapped it
around the end of the dropper He fitted the needle on over
the wet paper collar He opened one of the papers with
care not to flip the contents out by a spring motion of the
waxed paper
This is the coke he said Be careful its strong
stuff
I emptied the morphine paper into the spoon adding
a little water About half a grain I figured Nearer four
centogramos than ten I held a match under the spoon
until the morphine dissolved You never heat coke I added
a little coke on the end of a knife blade and the coke
dissolved instantly like snow hitting water I wrapped a
frayed tie around my arm My breath was short with excitement
and my hands shook
Hit me will you Ike
Old Ike poked a gentle finger along the vein holding
the dropper poised between thumb and fingers Ike was
good I hardly felt the needle slide in the vein Dark red
blood spurted into the dropper
OK he said Let it go
I loosened the tie and the dropper emptied into my
vein Coke hit my head a pleasant dizziness and tension
while the morphine spread through my body in relaxing
waves
Was that all right asked Ike smiling
If God made anything better he kept it for Himself7
I said
Ike was cleaning out the needle squirting water
through it Well he said inanely when the roll is called
up yonder well be there right
I sat down on the couch and lit a cigarette Old Ike
went Out into the kitchen to make a cup of tea He began
another installment in the endless saga of the Black Bastard
The Black Bastard is putting out to three guys now
Pickpockets all three of them and they make pretty good
in the market Pay off the cops He gives about four
centogramos in a shot for fifteen pesos He dont want to
talk to me now hes doing good the dirty bastard He
wont last a month you wait and see First time one of
those guys gets caught hes going to stool like that He
came to the kitchen door and snapped his fingers He
wont last a month His toothless mouth was twisted with
hate
When I jumped bail and left the States the heat on
junk already looked like something new and special Initial
symptoms of nationwide hysteria were clear Louisiana
passed a law making it a crime to be a drug addict Since
no place or time is specified and the term addict is not
clearly defined no proof is necessary or even relevant
under a law so formulated No proof and consequently no
trial This is policestate legislation penalizing a state of
being Other states were emulating Louisiana I saw my
chance of escaping Conviction dwindle daily as the antijunk
feeling mounted to a paranoid obsession like anti
Semitism under the Nazis So I decided to jump bail and
live permanently outside the United States
Safe in Mexico I watched the antijunk campaign I
read about child addicts and Senators demanding the death
penalty for dope peddlers It didnt sound right to me Who
wants kids for customers They never have enough money
and they always spill under questioning Parents find out
the kid is on junk and go to the law I figured that either
Stateside peddlers have gone simpleminded or the whole
childaddict setup is a routine to stir up antijunk sentiment
and pass some new laws
Refugee hipsters trickled down into Mexico Six
months for needle marks under the vagaddict law in California
Eight years for a dropper in Washington Two
to ten for selling in New York A group of young hipsters
dropped by my place every day to smoke weed
There was Cash a musician who played trumpet
There was Pete a heavyset blond who could have modeled
for a cleancut American Boy poster There was
Johnny White who had a wife and three children and
looked like any average young American There was Martin
a dark goodlooking kid of Italian stock No zootsuiters
The hipster has gone underground
I learned the new hipster vocabulary pot for weed
twisted for busted cool an allpurpose word indicating
anything you like or any situation that is not hot with the
law Conversely anything you dont like is uncool From
listening to these characters I got a picture of the situation
in the US A state of complete chaos where you never
know who is who or where you stand Oldtime junkies
told me If you ever see a man take a shot in the arm you
know be is not a Federal agent
This is no longer true Martin told me This cat fell
in and says hes sick He had the names of some friends of
ours in `Frisco So these two other cats turned him on H
and he was fixing right with them for over a week And
then they got busted I wasnt along when it happened
because I didnt dig this cat and I wasnt on H at the time
So the lawyer for these two cats that got twisted found out
the cat was a Federal narcotics agent An agent not a
pigeon Even found out his name
And Cash told me of cases where two hips take a fix
together and then one pulls out his badge
How can you beat it Cash said I mean these guys
are hips themselves Guys just like you and me with one
small difference  they work for Uncle
Now that the Narcotics Bureau has taken it upon
itself to incarcerate every addict in the US they need
more agents to do the work Not only more agents but a
different type of agent Like during prohibition when
bums and hoodlums flooded the Internal Revenue Department
now addictagents join the department for free junk
and immunity It is difficult to fake addiction An addict
knows an addict The addictagents manage to conceal
their addiction or perhaps they are tolerated because they
get results An agent who has to connect or go sick Wilt
bring a special zeal to his work
Cash the trumpet player who did six months on the
vagaddict rap was a tall skinny young man with a ragged
goatee and dark glasses He wore shoes with thick crepe
leather soles expensive camelhair shirts and a leather
jacket you tie with a belt in front You could see he had
about a hundred dollars in haberdashery on his person His
old lady had the money and Cash was spending it When I
met him the money was about gone Cash told me
Women come to me I dont care about women The only
thing gives me a real kick is playing trumpet
Cash was a junk mooch on wheels He made it difficult
to refuse He would lend me small amounts of money
 never enough to cover the junk he used  and then say
he had given me all his money and had no money left to
buy codeine pills He told me he was getting off the junk
When he arrived in Mexico I gave him half a grain of M
and he went on the nod I guess the stuff they sell now
Stateside is cut tight down to the paper
After that he would drop around every day and ask
me for half a fix Or he would mooch junk off Old Ike
who couldnt turn down anyone sick I told Old Ike to
pack him in and explained to Cash I wasnt in the junk
business and Old Ike wasnt really in the business either
Certainly he wasnt in the business for nothing In short
we were not the junkies benevolent society From then on
I didnt see much of Cash
Peyote is a new kick in the States It isnt under the
Harrison Act and you can buy it from herb dealers
through the mail I had never tried peyote and I asked
Johnny White if he could score for peyote in Mexico
He said Yes An herb dealer here sells it He invited
all of us to come to his place and eat peyote with him You
can come along if you like I want to see if he has anything
I can take back to the States and sell there
Why not take back peyote
It doesnt keep it rots or dries up in a few days and
loses its kick We went to the herb dealers house and he
brought out a bowl of peyote a grater and a pot of tea
Peyote is a small cactus and only the top part that
appears above the ground is eaten This is called a button
The buttons are prepared by peeling off the bark and fuzz
and running the button through a grater until it looks like
avocado salad Four buttons is the average dose for a beginner
We washed down the peyote with tea I came near
gagging on it several times Finally I got it all down and sat
there waiting for something to happen The herb dealer
brought out some bark he claimed was like opium Johnny
rolled a cigarette of the stuff and passed it around Pete
and Johnny said Crazy This is the greatest
I smoked some and felt a little dizzy and my throat
hurt But Johnny bought some of that awfulsmelling bark
with the intention of selling it to desperate hipsters in the
US
After ten minutes I began to feel sick from the peyote
Everyone told me Keep it down man I held out ten
minutes more then headed for the WC ready to throw in
the towel but I couldnt vomit My whole body contracted
in a convulsive spasm but the peyote wouldnt come up It
wouldnt stay down either
Finally the peyote came up solid like a ball of hair
solid all the way up clogging my throat As horrible a
sensation as I ever stood still for After that the high came
on slow
Peyote high is something like benzedrine high You
cant sleep and your pupils are dilated Everything looks
like a peyote plant I was driving in the car with the Whites
and Cash and Pete We were going out to Cashs place in
the Lamas Johnny said Look at the bank along the road
It looks like a peyote plant
I turned around to look and was thinking What a
damn silly idea People can talk themselves into anything
But it did look like a peyote plant Everything I saw looked
like a peyote plant
Our faces swelled under the eyes and our lips got
thicker through some glandular action of the drug We
actually looked like Indians The others claimed they felt
primitive and were laying around on the grass and acting
the way they figured Indians act I didnt feel any different
from ordinary except high like on benny
We sat up all night talking and listening to Cashs
records Cash told me about several cats from `Frisco who
had kicked junk habits with peyote It seems like they
didnt want junk when they started using peyote One of
these junkies came down to Mexico and started taking
peyote with the Indians He was using it all the time in
large quantities up to twelve buttons in one dose He died
of a condition that was diagnosed as polio I understand
however that the symptoms of peyote poisoning and polio
are identical
I couldnt sleep until the next morning at dawn and
then I had a nightmare every time I dozed off In one
dream I was coming down with rabies I looked in the
mirror and my face changed and I began howling In another
dream I had a chlorophyll habit Me and about five
other chlorophyll addicts are waiting to score on the landing
of a cheap Mexican hotel We turn green and no one
can kick a chlorophyll habit One shot and youre hung for
life We are turning into plants
The young hipsters seem Jacking in energy and spontaneous
enjoyment of life The mention of pot or junk will
galvanize them like a shot of coke They jump around and
say Too much Man lets pick up Lets get loaded But
after a shot they slump into a chair like a resigned baby
waiting for life to bring the bottle again
I found that their interests were very limited Particularly
I noticed they seemed less interested in sex than my
generation Some of them expressed themselves as not getting
any kick out of sex at all I have frequently been
misled to believe a young man was queer after observing
his indifference to women and found out subsequently he
was not at all homosexual but simply disinterested in the
whole subject
Bill Gains threw in the towel and moved to Mexico I
met him at the airport He was loaded on H and goof balls
His pants were spotted with blood where he had been
fixing on the plane with a safety pin You make a hole with
the pin and put the dropper over not in the hole and
the solution goes right in With this method you dont
need a needle but it takes an oldtime junky to make it
work You have to use exactly the right degree of pressure
feeding in the solution I tried it once and the junk squirted
out to the side and I lost it all But when Gains made a
hole in his flesh the hole stayed open waiting for junk
Bill was an oldtimer He knew everybody in the business
He had an excellent reputation and he could score as
long as anyone sold junk I figured the situation must be
desperate when Bill packed in and left the States
Sure I can score he told me But if I stay in the
States Ill wind up doing about ten years
I took a shot with him and the whathappenedtosoand
so routine set in
Old Bart died on the Island Louie the Bell Hop went
wrong Tony and Nick went wrong Herman didnt make
parole The Gimp got five to ten Marvin the waiter died
from an overdose
I remembered the way Marvin used to pass out every
time he took a shot I could see him lying on the bed in
some cheap hotel the dropper full of blood hanging to his
vein like a glass leech his face turning blue around the
lips
What about Roy I asked
Didnt you hear about him He went wrong and
hanged himself in the Tombs It seems the law had Roy
on three counts two larceny one narcotics They promised
to drop all charges if Roy would set up Eddie Crump an
oldtime pusher Eddie only served people he knew well
and he knew Roy The law doublecrossed Roy after they
got Eddie They dropped the narcotics charge but not the
two larceny charges So Roy was slated to follow Eddie up
to Rikers Island where Eddie was doing pen indefinite
which is maximum in City Prison Three years five
months and six days Roy hanged himself in the Tombs
where he was awaiting transfer to Rikers
Roy had always taken an intolerant and puritanical
view of pigeons I dont see how a pigeon can live with
himself he said to me once
I asked Bill about child addicts He nodded and
smiled a sly gloating smile Yes Lexington is full of
young kids now
One day I was in the Opera Bar in Mexico City and
ran into a politician I knew He was standing at the bar
with a napkin tucked in his collar eating a steak Between
mouthfuls he asked me did I know anyone who might be
interested to buy an ounce of heroin
I said Maybe How much
He said They want five hundred dollars
I talked to Bill Gains and he said All right If its
anywhere near pure Ill take it But no sight unseen I have
to try the stuff first
So I arranged it with the politician and we went down
to his office He brought the stuff out of a drawer in a
finger stall and laid it on the desk beside a 45 automatic
I dont know anything about this stuff he said All
I use is cocaine
I poured some out on a piece of paper It didnt look
right to me Sort of grayblack I guess they had cooked
it up some place on a kitchen stove
Gains took a shot but he was so loaded already on
goof balls and M he couldnt tell one way or the other So I
took a shot and told him Its H but theres something not
exactly right about it
People meanwhile were walking in and out of the
office Nobody paid us any mind sitting there on the couch
with our sleeves rolled up probing for veins with the
needle Anything can happen in the office of a Mexican
politician
Anyway Bill bought the H and I went somewhere and
didnt see him until next day eleven oclock on a bright
Mexican morning standing by my bed cadaverous in his
blueblack overcoat his eyes brighter than I ever saw them
gleaming in the darkness of the curtained room He stood
there with the impurities of amateur H in his brain like
spirochetes
You just going to lie there on your bed he asked
With all these shipments coming in
Why not I said annoyed This isnt any fucking
farm    shipments of what
Good pure M he said Then shoes overcoat and
all he got right in bed with me
Whats the matter with you I asked You crazy
And looking into his bright blank eyes I saw that he was
I got him back to his room and confiscated what was
left of the piece of H
Old Ike showed and we poured ten centimeters of
laudanum down Bills gullet After that he stopped raving
about shipments of good pure M and went to sleep
Maybe he die Old Ike said and they blame it onto
me
If he dies you clear out I said Listen Hes got six
hundred dollars cash in his wallet Why leave it for some
Mexican cop to steal
We shook the place down looking for the wallet but
could not find it We looked everywhere except under the
mattress where Bill was lying
Next day Bill was good as new but he couldnt find
his money
You must have stashed it I said Look under the
mattress
He turned up the mattress and the wallet sprung open
it was so full of crisp money
At this time I was not on junk but I was a long way
from being clean in the event of an unforeseen shake
There was always some weed around and people were
using my place as a shooting gallery I was taking chances
and not making one centavo I decided it was about time to
move out from under and head south
When you give up junk you give up a way of life I
have seen junkies kick and hit the lush and wind up dead
in a few years Suicide is frequent among exjunkies Why
does a junky quit junk of his own will You never know
the answer to that question No conscious tabulation of the
disadvantages and horrors of junk gives you the emotional
drive to kick The decision to quit junk is a cellular decision
and once you have decided to quit you cannot go
back to junk permanently any more than you could stay
away from it before Like a man who has been away a long
time you see things different when you return from junk
I read about a drug called yage used by Indians in the
headwaters of the Amazon Yage is supposed to increase
telepathic sensitivity A Colombian scientist isolated from
yage a drug he called telepathine
I know from my own experience that telepathy is a
fact I have no interest in proving telepathy or anything to
anybody I do want usable knowledge of telepathy What I
look for in any relationship is contact on the nonverbal
level of intuition and feeling that is telepathic contact
Apparently I am not the only one interested in yage
The Russians are using this drug in experiments on slave
labor They want to induce states of automatic obedience
and literal thought control The basic con No buildup no
routine just move in on someones psyche and give orders
The deal is certain to backfire because telepathy is not in
itself a oneway setup or a setup of sender and receiver at
all
I decided to go down to Colombia and score for yage
Bill Gains is squared away with Old Ike My wife and I are
separated I am ready to move on south and look for the
uncut kick that opens out instead of narrowing down like
junk
Kick is seeing things from a special angle Kick is
momentary freedom from the claims of the aging cautious
nagging frightened flesh Maybe I will find in yage
what I was looking for in junk and weed and coke Yage
may be the final fix

When I lived in Mexico City at the end of the 1940s it was a city of one million people with clear
sparkling air and the sky that special shade of blue that goes so well with circling vultures blood
and sand—the raw menacing pitiless Mexican blue I liked Mexico City from the first day of my
first visit there In 1949 it was a cheap place to live with a large foreign colony fabulous
whorehouses and restaurants cockfights and bullfights and every conceivable diversion A
single man could live well there for two dollars a day My New Orleans case for heroin and
marijuana possession looked so unpromising that I decided not to show up for the court date and
I rented an apartment in a quiet middleclass neighborhood of Mexico City
I knew that under the statute of limitations I could not return to the United States for five years so
I applied for Mexican citizenship and enrolled in some courses in Mayan and Mexican
archaeology at Mexico City College The GI Bill paid for my books and tuition and a seventyfive
dollarpermonth living allowance I thought I might go into farming or perhaps open a bar on
the American border
The City appealed to me The slum areas compared favorably with anything in Asia for sheer filth
and poverty People would shit all over the street then lie down and sleep in it with the flies
crawling in and out of their mouths Entrepreneurs not infrequently lepers built fires on street
corners and cooked up hideous stinking nameless messes of food which they dispensed to
passersby Drunks slept right on the sidewalks of the main drag and no cops bothered them It
seemed to me that everyone in Mexico had mastered the art of minding his own business If a
man wanted to wear a monocle or carry a cane he did not hesitate to do it and no one gave him
a second glance Boys and young men walked down the street arm in arm and no one paid them
any mind It wasnt that people didnt care what others thought; it simply would not occur to a
Mexican to expect criticism from a stranger nor to criticize the behavior of others
Mexico was basically an Oriental culture that reflected two thousand years of disease and poverty
and degradation and stupidity and slavery and brutality and psychic and physical terrorism It was
sinister and gloomy and chaotic with the special chaos of a dream No Mexican really knew any
other Mexican and when a Mexican killed someone which happened often it was usually his
best friend Anyone who felt like it carried a gun and I read of several occasions where drunken
cops shooting at the habitués of a bar were themselves shot by armed civilians As authority
figures Mexican cops ranked with streetcar conductors
All officials were corruptible income tax was very low and medical treatment was extremely
reasonable because the doctors advertised and cut their prices You could get a clap cured for
$240 or buy the penicillin and shoot it yourself There were no regulations curtailing selfmedication
and needles and syringes could be bought anywhere This was in the time of
Alemán when the mordida was king and a pyramid of bribes reached from the cop on the beat
up to the Presidente Mexico City was also the murder capital of the world with the highest percapita
homicide rate I remember newspaper stories every day like these
A campesino is in from the country waiting for a bus linen pants sandals made from a tire a
wide sombrero a machete at his belt Another man is also waiting dressed in a suit looking at
his wrist watch muttering angrily The campesino whips out his machete and cuts the mans head
clean off He later told police He was giving me looks muy feo and finally I could not contain
myself Obviously the man was annoyed because the bus was late and was looking down the
road for the bus when the campesino misinterpreted his action and the next thing a head rolls in
the gutter grimacing horribly and showing gold teeth
Two campesinos are sitting disconsolate by the roadside They have no money for breakfast But
look a boy leading several goats One campesino picks up a rock and bashes the boys brains
out They take the goats to the nearest village and sell them They are eating breakfast when they
are apprehended by the police
A man lives in a little house A stranger asks him how to find the road for Ayahuasca Ah this
way señor He is leading the man around and around The road is right here Suddenly he
realizes he hasnt any idea where the road is and why should he be bothered So he picks up a
rock and kills his tormentor
Campesinos took their toll with rock and machete More murderous were the politicians and offduty
cops each with his 45 automatic One learned to hit the deck Here is another actual story
A guntoting político hears his girl is cheating meeting someone in this cocktail lounge Some
American kid just happens in and sits next to her when the macho bursts in ¡CHINGOA Hauls
out his 45 and blasts the kid right off his bar stool They drag the body outside and down the
street a ways When the cops arrive the bartender shrugs and mops his bloody bar and says
only Malos esos muchachos Those bad boys
Every country has its own special Shits like the Southern lawman counting his Nigger notches
and the sneering Mexican macho is certainly up there when it comes to sheer ugliness And
many of the Mexican middle class are about as awful as any bourgeoisie in the world I remember
that in Mexico the narcotic scripts were bright yellow like a thousanddollar bill or a dishonorable
discharge from the Army One time Old Dave and I tried to fill such a script which he had
obtained quite legitimately from the Mexican government The first pharmacist we hit jerked back
snarling from such a sight ¡No prestamos servicio a los viciosos We do not serve dope
fiends
From one farmacía to another we walked getting sicker with every step No señor    We
must have walked for miles
Never been in this neighborhood before
Well lets try one more
Finally we entered a tiny holeinthewall farmacía I pulled out the receta and a grayhaired lady
smiled at me The pharmacist looked at the script and said Two minutes señor
We sat down to wait There were geraniums in the window A small boy brought me a glass of
water and a cat rubbed against my leg After awhile the pharmacist returned with our morphine
Gracias señor
Outside the neighborhood now seemed enchanted Little farmacías in a market crates and stalls
outside a pulquería on the corner Kiosks selling fried grasshoppers and peppermint candy black
with flies Boys in from the country in spotless white linen and rope sandals with faces of
burnished copper and fierce innocent black eyes like exotic animals of a dazzling sexless
beauty Here is a boy with sharp features and black skin smelling of vanilla a gardenia behind
his ear Yes you found a Johnson but you waded through Shitville to find him You always do
Just when you think the earth is exclusively populated by Shits you meet a Johnson
One day there was a knock on my door at eight in the morning I went to the door in my pyjamas
and there was an inspector from Immigration
Get your clothes on Youre under arrest It seemed the woman next door had turned in a long
report on my drunk and disorderly behavior and also there was something wrong with my papers
and where was the Mexican wife I was supposed to have The Immigration officers were all set
to throw me in jail to await deportation as an undesirable alien Of course everything could be
straightened out with some money but my interviewer was the head of the deporting department
and he wouldnt go for peanuts I finally had to get up off of two hundred dollars As I walked
home from the Immigration Office I imagined what I might have had to pay if I had really had an
investment in Mexico City
I thought of the constant problems the three American owners of the Ship Ahoy encountered The
cops came in all the time for a mordida and then came the sanitary inspectors then more cops
trying to get something on the joint so they could take a real bite They took the waiter downtown
and beat the shit out of him They wanted to know where was Kellys body stashed How many
women been raped in the joint Who brought in the weed And so on Kelly was an American
hipster who had been shot in the Ship Ahoy six months before had recovered and was now in
the US Army No woman was ever raped there and no one ever smoked weed there By now
I had entirely abandoned my plans to open a bar in Mexico
An addict has little regard for his image He wears the dirtiest shabbiest clothes and feels no
need to call attention to himself During my period of addiction in Tangiers I was known as El
Hombre Invisible The Invisible Man This disintegration of selfimage often results in an
indiscriminate image hunger Billie Holliday said she knew she was off junk when she stopped
watching TV In my first novel Junky the protagonist Lee comes across as integrated and selfcontained
sure of himself and where he is going In Queer he is disintegrated desperately in
need of contact completely unsure of himself and of his purpose
The difference of course is simple Lee on junk is covered protected and also severely limited
Not only does junk shortcircuit the sex drive it also blunts emotional reactions to the vanishing
point depending on the dosage Looking back over the action of Queer that hallucinated month
of acute withdrawal takes on a hellish glow of menace and evil drifting out of neonlit cocktail
bars the ugly violence the 45 always just under the surface On junk I was insulated didnt
drink didnt go out much just shot up and waited for the next shot
When the cover is removed everything that has been held in check by junk spills out The
withdrawing addict is subject to the emotional excesses of a child or an adolescent regardless of
his actual age And the sex drive returns in full force Men of sixty experience wet dreams and
spontaneous orgasms an extremely unpleasant experience agaçant as the French say putting
the teeth on edge Unless the reader keeps this in mind the metamorphosis of Lees character
will appear as inexplicable or psychotic Also bear in mind that the withdrawal syndrome is selflimiting
lasting no more than a month And Lee has a phase of excessive drinking which
exacerbates all the worst and most dangerous aspects of the withdrawal sickness reckless
unseemly outrageous maudlin—in a word appalling—behavior
After withdrawal the organism readjusts and stabilizes at a prejunk level In the narrative this
stabilization is finally reached during the South American trip No junk is available nor any other
drug after the paregoric of Panama Lees drinking has dwindled to several good stiff ones at
sundown Not so different from the Lee of the later Yage Letters except for the phantom
presence of Allerton
So I had written Junky and the motivation for that was comparatively simple to put down in the
most accurate and simple terms my experiences as an addict I was hoping for publication
money recognition Kerouac had published The Town and the City at the time I started writing
Junky I remember writing in a letter to him when his book was published that money and fame
were now assured As you can see I knew nothing about the writing business at the time
My motivations to write Queer were more complex and are not clear to me at the present time
Why should I wish to chronicle so carefully these extremely painful and unpleasant and lacerating
memories While it was I who wrote Junky I feel that I was being written in Queer I was also
taking pains to ensure further writing so as to set the record straight writing as inoculation As
soon as something is written it loses the power of surprise just as a virus loses its advantage
when a weakened virus has created alerted antibodies So I achieved some immunity from further
perilous ventures along these lines by writing my experience down
At the beginning of the Queer manuscript fragment having returned from the insulation of junk to
the land of the living like a frantic inept Lazarus Lee seems determined to score in the sexual
sense of the word There is something curiously systematic and unsexual about his quest for a
suitable sex object crossing one prospect after another off a list which seems compiled with
ultimate failure in mind On some very deep level he does not want to succeed but will go to any
length to avoid the realization that he is not really looking for sex contact
But Allerton was definitely some sort of contact And what was the contact that Lee was looking
for Seen from here a very confused concept that had nothing to do with Allerton as a character
While the addict is indifferent to the impression he creates in others during withdrawal he may
feel the compulsive need for an audience and this is clearly what Lee seeks in Allerton an
audience the acknowledgement of his performance which of course is a mask to cover a
shocking disintegration So he invents a frantic attentiongetting format which he calls the
Routine shocking funny riveting It is an Ancient Mariner and he stoppeth one of three
The performance takes the form of routines fantasies about Chess Players the Texas Oilman
Corn Hole Guss UsedSlave Lot In Queer Lee addresses these routines to an actual audience
Later as he develops as a writer the audience becomes internalized But the same mechanism
that produced AJ and Doctor Benway the same creative impulse is dedicated to Allerton who
is forced into the role of approving Muse in which he feels understandably uncomfortable
What Lee is looking for is contact or recognition like a photon emerging from the haze of
insubstantiality to leave an indelible recording in Allertons consciousness Failing to find an
adequate observer he is threatened by painful dispersal like an unobserved photon Lee does
not know that he is already committed to writing since this is the only way he has of making an
indelible record whether Allerton is inclined to observe or not Lee is being inexorably pressed
into the world of fiction He has already made the choice between his life and his work
The manuscript trails off in Puyo End of the Road town    The search for Yage has failed The
mysterious Doctor Cotter wants only to be rid of his unwelcome guests He suspects them to be
agents of his treacherous partner Gill intent on stealing his genius work of isolating curare from
the composite arrow poison I heard later that the chemical companies decided simply to buy up
the arrow poison in quantity and extract the curare in their American laboratories The drug was
soon synthesized and is now a standard substance found in many musclerelaxing preparations
So it would seem that Cotter really had nothing to lose his efforts were already superseded
Dead end And Puyo can serve as a model for the Place of Dead Roads a dead meaningless
conglomerate of tinroofed houses under a continual downpour of rain Shell has pulled out
leaving prefabricated bungalows and rusting machinery behind And Lee has reached the end of
his line an end implicit in the beginning He is left with the impact of unbridgeable distances the
defeat and weariness of a long painful journey made for nothing wrong turnings the track lost a
bus waiting in the rain    back to Ambato Quito Panama Mexico City
When I started to write this companion text to Queer I was paralyzed with a heavy reluctance a
writers block like a straitjacket I glance at the manuscript of Queer and feel I simply cant read it
My past was a poisoned river from which one was fortunate to escape and by which one feels
immediately threatened years after the events recorded —Painful to an extent I find it difficult to
read let alone to write about Every word and gesture sets the teeth on edge The reason for this
reluctance becomes clearer as I force myself to look the book is motivated and formed by an
event which is never mentioned in fact is carefully avoided the accidental shooting death of my
wife Joan in September 1951
While I was writing The Place of Dead Roads I felt in spiritual contact with the late English writer
Denton Welch and modelled the novels hero Kim Carson directly on him Whole sections came
to me as if dictated like tabletapping I have written about the fateful morning of Dentons
accident which left him an invalid for the remainder of his short life If he had stayed a little longer
here not so long there he would have missed his appointment with the female motorist who hit
his bicycle from behind for no apparent reason At one point Denton had stopped to have coffee
and looking at the brass hinges on the cafés window shutters some of them broken he was hit
by a feeling of universal desolation and loss So every event of that morning is charged with
special significance as if it were underlined This portentous second sight permeates Welchs
writing a scone a cup of tea an inkwell purchased for a few shillings become charged with a
special and often sinister significance
I get exactly the same feeling to an almost unbearable degree as I read the manuscript of Queer
The event towards which Lee feels himself inexorably driven is the death of his wife by his own
hand the knowledge of possession a dead hand waiting to slip over his like a glove So a smog
of menace and evil rises from the pages an evil that Lee knowing and yet not knowing tries to
escape with frantic flights of fantasy his routines which set ones teeth on edge because of the
ugly menace just behind or to one side of them a presence palpable as a haze
Brion Gysin said to me in Paris For ugly spirit shot Joan because    A bit of mediumistic
message that was not completed—or was it It doesnt need to be completed if you read it ugly
spirit shot Joan to be cause that is to maintain a hateful parasitic occupation My concept of
possession is closer to the medieval model than to modern psychological explanations with their
dogmatic insistence that such manifestations must come from within and never never never
from without As if there were some clearcut difference between inner and outer I mean a
definite possessing entity And indeed the psychological concept might well have been devised
by the possessing entities since nothing is more dangerous to a possessor than being seen as a
separate invading creature by the host it has invaded And for this reason the possessor shows
itself only when absolutely necessary
In 1939 I became interested in Egyptian hieroglyphics and went out to see someone in the
Department of Egyptology at the University of Chicago And something was screaming in my ear
YOU DONT BELONG HERE Yes the hieroglyphics provided one key to the mechanism of
possession Like a virus the possessing entity must find a port of entry
This occasion was my first clear indication of something in my being that was not me and not
under my control I remember a dream from this period I worked as an exterminator in Chicago
in the late 1930s and lived in a rooming house on the near North Side In the dream I am floating
up near the ceiling with a feeling of utter death and despair and looking down I see my body
walking out the door with deadly purpose
One wonders if Yage could have saved the day by a blinding revelation I remember a cutup I
made in Paris years later Raw peeled winds of hate and mischance blew the shot And for
years I thought this referred to blowing a shot of junk when the junk squirts out the side of the
syringe or dropper owing to an obstruction Brion Gysin pointed out the actual meaning the shot
that killed Joan
I had bought a Scout knife in Quito It had a metal handle and a curious tarnished old look like
something from a turnofthecentury junk shop I can see it in a tray of old knives and rings with
the silver plate flaking off It was about three oclock in the afternoon a few days after I came
back to Mexico City and I decided to have the knife sharpened The knifesharpener had a little
whistle and a fixed route and as I walked down the street towards his cart a feeling of loss and
sadness that had weighed on me all day so I could hardly breathe intensified to such an extent
that I found tears streaming down my face
What on earth is wrong I wondered
This heavy depression and a feeling of doom occurs again and again in the text Lee usually
attributes it to his failures with Allerton A heavy drag slowed movement and thought Lees face
was rigid his voice toneless Allerton has just refused a dinner invitation and left abruptly Lee
stared at the table his thoughts slow as if he were very cold Reading this  am cold and
depressed
Here is a precognitive dream from Cotters shack in Ecuador He was standing in front of the
Ship Ahoy The place looked deserted He could hear someone crying He saw his little son and
knelt down and took the child in his arms The sound of crying came closer a wave of sadness
 He held little Willy close against his chest A group of people were standing there in Convict
suits Lee wondered what they were doing there and why he was crying
I have constrained myself to remember the day of Joans death the overwhelming feeling of
doom and loss    walking down the street I suddenly found tears streaming down my face
What is wrong with me The small Scout knife with a metal handle the plating peeling off a
smell of old coins the knifesharpeners whistle Whatever happened to this knife I never
reclaimed
I am forced to the appalling conclusion that I would never have become a writer but for Joans
death and to a realization of the extent to which this event has motivated and formulated my
writing I live with the constant threat of possession and a constant need to escape from
possession from Control So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader the Ugly
Spirit and maneuvered me into a lifelong struggle in which I have had no choice except to write
my way out
I have constrained myself to escape death Denton Welch is almost my face Smell of old coins
Whatever happened to this knife called Allerton back to the appalling Margaras Inc The
realization is basic formulated doing The day of Joans doom and loss Found tears streaming
down from Allerton peeling off the same person as a Western shootist What are you rewriting
A lifelong preoccupation with Control and Virus Having gained access the virus uses the hosts
energy blood flesh and bones to make copies of itself Model of dogmatic insistence never never
from without was screaming in my ear YOU DONT BELONG HERE
A straitjacket notation carefully paralyzed with heavy reluctance To escape their prewritten lines
years after the events recorded A writers block avoided Joans death Denton Welch is Kim
Carsons voice through a cloud underlined broken table tapping
Lee turned his attention to a Jewish boy named Carl Steinberg whom he had known casually for
about a year The first time he saw Carl Lee thought I could use that if the family jewels werent
in pawn to Uncle Junk
The boy was blond his face thin and sharp with a few freckles always a little pink around the
ears and nose as though he had just washed Lee had never known anyone to look as clean as
Carl With his small round brown eyes and fuzzy blond hair he reminded Lee of a young bird
Born in Munich Carl had grown up in Baltimore In manner and outlook he seemed European He
shook hands with traces of a heelclick In general Lee found European youths easier to talk to
than Americans The rudeness of many Americans depressed him a rudeness based on a solid
ignorance of the whole concept of manners and on the proposition that for social purposes all
people are more or less equal and interchangeable
What Lee looked for in any relationship was the feel of contact He felt some contact with Carl
The boy listened politely and seemed to understand what Lee was saying After some initial
balking he accepted the fact of Lees sexual interest in his person He told Lee Since I cant
change my mind about you I will have to change my mind about other things
But Lee soon found out he could make no progress If I got this far with an American kid he
reasoned I could get the rest of the way So hes not queer People can be obliging What is the
obstacle Lee finally guessed the answer What makes it impossible is that his mother wouldnt
like it And Lee knew it was time to pack in He recalled a homosexual Jewish friend who lived in
Oklahoma City Lee had asked Why do you live here You have enough money to live
anywhere you like The reply was It would kill my mother if I moved away Lee had been
speechless
One afternoon Lee was walking with Carl by the Amsterdam Avenue park Suddenly Carl bowed
slightly and shook Lees hand Best of luck he said and ran for a streetcar
Lee stood looking after him then walked over into the park and sat down on a concrete bench
that was molded to resemble wood Blue flowers from a blossoming tree had fallen on the bench
and on the walk in front of it Lee sat there watching the flowers move along the path in a warm
spring wind The sky was clouding up for an afternoon shower Lee felt lonely and defeated Ill
have to look for someone else he thought He covered his face with his hands He was very
tired
He saw a shadowy line of boys As each boy came to the front of the line he said Best of luck
and ran for a streetcar
Sorry    wrong number  try again    somewhere else    someplace else    not here   not
me  cant use it dont need it dont want it Why pick on me The last face was so real and so
ugly Lee said aloud Who asked you you ugly son of a bitch
Lee opened his eyes and looked around Two Mexican adolescents walked by their arms around
each others necks He looked after them licking his dry cracked lips
Lee continued to see Carl after that until finally Carl said Best of luck for the last time and
walked away Lee heard later he had gone with his family to Uruguay
Lee was sitting with Winston Moor in the Rathskeller drinking double tequilas Cuckoo clocks and
motheaten deer heads gave the restaurant a dreary outofplace Tyrolean look A smell of spilt
beer overflowing toilets and sour garbage hung in the place like a thick fog and drifted out into
the street through narrow inconvenient swinging doors A television set which was out of order
half the time and which emitted horrible guttural squawks was the final touch of unpleasantness
I was in here last night Lee said to Moor Got talking to a queer doctor and his boyfriend The
doctor was a major in the Medical Corps The boyfriend is some kind of vague engineer Awfullooking
little bitch So the doctor invites me to have a drink with them and the boyfriend is getting
jealous and I dont want a beer anyway which the doctor takes as a reflection on Mexico and on
his own person He begins the doyoulikeMexico routine So I tell him Mexico is okay some of
it but he personally is a pain in the ass Told him this in a nice way you understand Besides I
had to go home to my wife in any case
So he says You dont have any wife you are just as queer as I am I told him I dont know how
queer you are Doc and I aint about to find out It isnt as if you was a goodlooking Mexican
Youre a goddamned old uglylooking Mexican And that goes double for your motheaten
boyfriend I was hoping of course the deal wouldnt come to any extreme climax
You never knew Hatfield Of course not Before your time He killed a cargador in a pulquería
The deal cost him five hundred dollars Now figuring a cargador as rock bottom think how much
it would cost you to shoot a major in the Mexican Army
Moor called the waiter over Yo quiero un sandwich he said smiling at the waiter ¿Quel
sandwiches tiene
What do you want Lee asked annoyed at the interruption
I dont know exactly said Moor looking through the menu I wonder if they could make a
melted cheese sandwich on toasted wholewheat bread Moor turned back to the waiter with a
smile that was intended to be boyish
Lee closed his eyes as Moor launched an attempt to convey the concept of melted cheese on
wholewheat toast Moor was being charmingly helpless with his inadequate Spanish He was
putting down a littleboyinaforeigncountry routine Moor smiled into an inner mirror a smile
without a trace of warmth but it was not a cold smile it was the meaningless smile of senile
decay the smile that goes with false teeth the smile of a man grown old and stirsimple in the
solitary confinement of exclusive selflove
Moor was a thin young man with blond hair that was habitually somewhat long He had pale blue
eyes and very white skin There were dark patches under his eyes and two deep lines around the
mouth He looked like a child and at the same time like a prematurely aged man His face
showed the ravages of the death process the inroads of decay in flesh cut off from the living
charge of contact Moor was motivated literally kept alive and moving by hate but there was no
passion or violence in his hate Moors hate was a slow steady push weak but infinitely
persistent waiting to take advantage of any weakness in another The slow drip of Moors hate
had etched the lines of decay in his face He had aged without experience of life like a piece of
meat rotting on a pantry shelf
Moor made a practice of interrupting a story just before the point was reached Often he would
start a long conversation with a waiter or anybody else handy or he would go vague and distant
yawn and say What was that as though recalled to dull reality from reflections of which others
could have no concept
Moor began talking about his wife At first Bill she was so dependent on me that she used
literally to have hysterics when I had to go to the museum where I work I managed to build up
her ego to the point where she didnt need me and after that the only thing I could do was leave
There was nothing more I could do for her
Moor was putting down his sincere act My God Lee thought he really believes it
Lee ordered another double tequila Moor stood up Well I have to get going he said I have a
lot of things to do
Well listen said Lee How about dinner tonight
Moor said Well all right
At six in the KC Steak House
All right Moor left
Lee drank half the tequila the waiter put in front of him He had known Moor off and on in NY for
several years and never liked him Moor disliked Lee but then Moor didnt like anybody Lee told
himself You must be crazy making passes in that direction when you know what a bitch he is
These borderline characters can outbitch any fag
When Lee arrived at the KC Steak House Moor was already there With him he had Tom
Williams another Salt Lake City boy Lee thought He brought along a chaperone
 I like the guy Tom but I cant stand to be alone with him He keeps trying to go to bed with
me Thats what I dont like about queers You cant keep it on a basis of friendship  Yes Lee
could hear that conversation
During dinner Moor and Williams talked about a boat they planned to build at Ziuhuatenejo Lee
thought this was a silly project Boat building is a job for a professional isnt it Lee asked Moor
pretended not to hear
After dinner Lee walked back to Moors rooming house with Moor and Williams At the door Lee
asked Would you gentlemen care for a drink Ill get a bottle   He looked from one to the
other
Moor said Well no You see we want to work on the plans for this boat we are going to build
Oh said Lee Well Ill see you tomorrow How about meeting me for a drink in the Rathskeller
Say around five
Well I expect Ill be busy tomorrow
Yes but you have to eat and drink
Well you see this boat is more important to me than anything right now It will take up all my
time
Lee said Suit yourself and walked away
Lee was deeply hurt He could hear Moor saying Thanks for running interference Tom Well I
hope he got the idea Of course Lee is an interesting guy and all that    but this queer situation
is just more than I can take Tolerant looking at both sides of the question sympathetic up to a
point finally forced to draw a tactful but firm line And he really believes that Lee thought Like
that crap about building up his wifes ego He can revel in the satisfactions of virulent bitchiness
and simultaneously see himself as a saint Quite a trick
Actually Moors brushoff was calculated to inflict the maximum hurt possible under the
circumstances It put Lee in the position of a detestably insistent queer too stupid and too
insensitive to realize that his attentions were not wanted forcing Moor to tbe distasteful necessity
of drawing a diagram
Lee leaned against a lamppost for several minutes The shock had sobered him drained away
his drunken euphoria He realized how tired he was and how weak but he was not ready yet to
go home
Everything made in this country falls apart Lee thought He was examining the blade of his
stainlesssteel pocketknife The chrome plating was peeling off like silver paper Wouldnt
surprise me if I picked up a boy in the Alameda and his    Here comes honest Joe
Joe Guidry sat down at the table with Lee dropping bundles on the table and in the empty chair
He wiped off the top of a beer bottle with his sleeve and drank half the beer in a long gulp He
was a large man with a politicians red Irish face
What you know Lee asked
Not much Lee Except someone stole my typewriter And I know who took it It was that
Brazilian or whatever he is You know him Maurice
Maurice Is that the one you had last week The wrestler
You mean Louie the gym instructor No this is another one Louie has decided all that sort of
thing is very wrong and he tells me that I am going to burn in hell but he is going to heaven
Serious
Oh yes Well Maurice is as queer as I am Joe belched Excuse me If not queerer But he
wont accept it I think stealing my typewriter is a way he takes to demonstrate to me and to
himself that he is just in it for all he can get As a matter of fact hes so queer Ive lost interest in
him Not completely though When I see the little bastard Ill most likely invite him back to my
apartment instead of beating the shit out of him like I should
Lee tipped his chair back against the wall and looked around the room Someone was writing a
letter at the next table If he had overheard the conversation he gave no sign The proprietor was
reading the bullfight section of the paper spread out on the counter in front of him A silence
peculiar to Mexico seeped into the room a vibrating soundless hum
Joe finished his beer wiped his mouth with the hack of his hand and stared at the wall with
watery bloodshot blue eyes The silence seeped into Lees body and his face went slack and
blank The effect was curiously spectral as though you could see through his face The face was
ravaged and vicious and old but the clear green eyes were dreamy and innocent His lightbrown
hair was extremely fine and would not stay combed Generally it fell down across his
forehead and on occasion brushed the food he was eating or got in his drink
Well I have to be going said Joe He gathered up his bundles and nodded to Lee bestowing
on him one of his sweet politician smiles and walked out his fuzzy halfbald head outlined for a
moment in the sunlight before he disappeared from view
Lee yawned and picked up a comic section from the next table It was two days old He put it
down and yawned again He got up and paid for his drink and walked out into the late afternoon
sun He had no place to go so he went over to Sears magazine counter and read the new
magazines for free
He cut back past the KC Steak House Moor beckoned to him from inside the restaurant Lee
went in and sat down at his table You look terrible he said He knew that was what Moor
wanted to hear As a matter of fact Moor did look worse than usual He had always been pale;
now he was yellowish
The boat project had fallen through Moor and
Williams and Williams wife Lil were back from Ziuhuatenejo Moor was not on speaking terms
with the Williamses
Lee ordered a pot of tea Moor started talking about Lil You know Lil ate the cheese down
there She ate everything and she never got sick She wont go to a doctor One morning she
woke up blind in one eye and she could barely see out the other But she wouldnt have a doctor
In a few days she could see again good as ever I was hoping shed go blind
Lee realized Moor was perfectly serious Hes insane Lee thought
Moor went on about Lil She had made advances to him of course He had paid more than his
share of the rent and food She was a terrible cook They had left him there sick He shifted to the
subject of his health Just let me show you my urine test Moor said with boyish enthusiasm He
spread the piece of paper out on the table Lee looked at it without interest
Look here Moor pointed Urea thirteen Normal is fifteen to twentytwo Is that serious do you
think
Im sure I dont know
And traces of sugar What does the whole picture mean Moor obviously considered the
question of intense interest
Why dont you take it to a doctor I did He said he would have to take a twentyfourhour test
that is samples of urine over a twentyfourhour period before he could express any opinion
You know I have a dull pain in the chest right here I wonder if it could be tuberculosis
Take an xray
I did The doctor is going to take a skin reaction test Oh another thing I think I have undulant
fever  Do you think I have fever now He pushed his forehead forward for Lee to feel Lee felt
an ear lobe I dont think so he said
Moor went on and on following the circular route of the true hypochondriac back to tuberculosis
and the urine test Lee thought he had never heard anything as tiresome and depressing Moor
did not have tuberculosis or kidney trouble or undulant fever He was sick with the sickness of
death Death was in every cell of his body He gave off a faint greenish steam of decay Lee
imagined he would glow in the dark
Moor talked with boyish eagerness I think I need an operation
Lee said he really had to go
Lee turned down Coahuila walking with one foot falling directly in front of the other always fast
and purposeful as if he were leaving the scene of a holdup He passed a group in expatriate
uniform redchecked shirt outside the belt blue jeans and beard and another group of young
men in conventional if shabby clothes Among these Lee recognized a boy named Eugene
Allerton Allerton was tall and very thin with high cheekbones a small brightred mouth and
ambercolored eyes that took on a faint violet flush when he was drunk His goldbrown hair was
differentially bleached by the sun like a sloppy dyeing job He had straight black eyebrows and
black eyelashes An equivocal face very young cleancut and boyish at the same time
conveying an impression of makeup delicate and exotic and Oriental Allerton was never
completely neat or clean but you did not think of him as being dirty He was simply careless and
lazy to the point of appearing at times only half awake Often he did not hear what someone said
a foot from his ear Pellagra I expect thought Lee sourly He nodded to Allerton and smiled
Allerton nodded as if surprised and did not smile
Lee walked on a little depressed Perhaps I can accomplish something in that direction Well a
ver    He froze in front of a restaurant like a bird dog Hungry    quicker to eat here than buy
something and cook it When Lee was hungry when he wanted a drink or a shot of morphine
delay was unbearable
He went in ordered steak a la Mexicana and a glass of milk and waited with his mouth watering
for food A young man with a round face and a loose mouth came into the restaurant Lee said
Hello Horace in a clear voice Horace nodded without speaking and sat down as far from Lee
as he could get in the small restaurant Lee smiled His food arrived and he ate quickly like an
animal cramming bread and steak into his mouth and washing it down with gulps of milk He
leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette
Un café sólo he called to the waitress as she walked by carrying a pineapple soda to two
young Mexicans in doublebreasted pinstripe suits One of the Mexicans had moist brown popeyes
and a scraggly moustache of greasy black hairs He looked pointedly at Lee and Lee
looked away Careful he thought or he will be over here asking me how I like Mexico He
dropped his halfsmoked cigarette into half an inch of cold coffee walked over to the counter
paid the bill and was out of the restaurant before the Mexican could formulate an opening
sentence When Lee decided to leave some place his departure was abrupt
The Ship Ahoy had a few phony hurricane lamps by way of a nautical atmosphere Two small
rooms with tables the bar in one room and four high precarious stools The place was always
dimly lit and sinisterlooking The patrons were tolerant but in no way bohemian The bearded set
never frequented the Ship Ahoy The place existed on borrowed time without a liquor license
under many changes of management At this time it was run by an American named Tom Weston
and an Americanborn Mexican
Lee walked directly to the bar and ordered a drink He drank it and ordered a second one before
looking around the room to see if Allerton was there Allerton was alone at a table tipped back in
a chair with one leg crossed over the other holding a bottle of beer on his knee He nodded to
Lee Lee tried to achieve a greeting at once friendly and casual designed to show interest without
pushing their short acquaintance The result was ghastly
As Lee stood aside to bow in his dignified oldworld greeting there emerged instead a leer of
naked lust wrenched in the pain and hate of his deprived body and in simultaneous double
exposure a sweet childs smile of liking and trust shockingly out of time and out of place
mutilated and hopeless
Allerton was appalled Perhaps he has some sort of tic he thought He decided to remove
himself from contact with Lee before the man did something even more distasteful The effect
was like a broken connection Allerton was not cold or hostile; Lee simply wasnt there so far as
he was concerned Lee looked at him helplessly for a moment then turned back to the bar
defeated and shaken
Lee finished his second drink When he looked around again Allerton was playing chess with
Mary an American girl with dyed red hair and carefully applied makeup who had come into the
bar in the meantime Why waste time here Lee thought He paid for the two drinks and walked
out
He took a cab to the Chimu Bar which was a fag bar frequented by Mexicans and spent the
night with a young boy he met there
At that time the GI students patronized Lolas during the daytime and the Ship Ahoy at night
Lolas was not exactly a bar It was a small beerandsoda joint There was a CocaCola box full
of beer and soda and ice at the left of the door as you came in A counter with tubemetal stools
covered in yellow glazed leather ran down one side of the room as far as the juke box Tables
were lined along the wall opposite the counter The stools had long since lost the rubber caps for
the legs and made horrible screeching noises when the maid pushed them around to sweep
There was a kitchen in back where a slovenly cook fried everything in rancid fat There was
neither past nor future in Lolas The place was a waiting room where certain people checked in
at certain times
Several days after his pickup in the Chimu Lee was sitting in Lolas reading aloud from Últimas
Notícias to Jim Cochan There was a story about a man who murdered his wife and children
Cochan looked about for a means to escape but every time he made a move to go Lee pinned
him down with Get a load of this    When his wife came home from the market her husband
already drunk was brandishing his 45 Why do they always have to brandish it
Lee read to himself for a moment Cochan stirred uneasily Jesus Christ said Lee looking up
After he killed his wife and three children he takes a razor and puts on a suicide act He
returned to the paper But resulted only with scratches that did not require medical attention
What a slobbish performance He turned the page and began reading the leads halfaloud
Theyre cutting the butter with Vaseline Fine thing Lobster with drawn KY    Heres a man
was surprised in his taco stand with a dresseddown dog  a great long skinny hound dog at that
Theres a picture of him posing in front of his taco stand with the dog    One citizen asked
another for a light The party in second part dont have a match so first part pulls an ice pick and
kills him Murder is the national neurosis of Mexico
Cochan stood up Lee was on his feet instantly Sit down on your ass or whats left of it after four
years in the Navy he said
I got to go
What are you henpecked
No kidding I been out too much lately My old lady
Lee wasnt listening He had just seen Allerton stroll by outside the door and look in Allerton had
not greeted Lee but walked on after a momentary pause I was in the shadow Lee thought
He couldnt see me from the door Lee did not notice Cochans departure
On a sudden impulse he rushed out the door Allerton was half a block away Lee overtook him
Allerton turned raising his eyebrows which were straight and black as a pen stroke He looked
surprised and a bit alarmed since he was dubious of Lees sanity Lee improvised desperately
I just wanted to tell you Mary was in Lolas a little while ago She asked me to tell you she would
be in the Ship Ahoy later on around five This was partly true Mary had been in and had asked
Lee if he had seen Allerton
Allerton was relieved Oh thank you he said quite cordial now Will you be around tonight
Yes I think so Lee nodded and smiled and turned away quickly
Lee left his apartment for the Ship Ahoy just before five Allerton was sitting at the bar Lee sat
down and ordered a drink then turned to Allerton with a casual greeting as though they were on
familiar and friendly terms Allerton returned the greeting automatically before he realized that
Lee had somehow established himself on a familiar basis whereas he had previously decided to
have as little to do with Lee as possible Allerton had a talent for ignoring people but he was not
competent at dislodging someone from a position already occupied
Lee began talking—casual unpretentiously intelligent dryly humorous Slowly he dispelled
Allertons impression that he was a peculiar and undesirable character When Mary arrived Lee
greeted her with a tipsy oldworld gallantry and excusing himself left them to a game of chess
Who is he asked Mary when Lee had gone outside
I have no idea said Allerton Had he ever met Lee He could not be sure Formal introductions
were not expected among the GI students Was Lee a student Allerton had never seen him at
the school There was nothing unusual in talking to someone you didnt know but Lee put
Allerton on guard The man was somehow familiar to him When Lee talked he seemed to mean
more than what he said A special emphasis to a word or a greeting hinted at a period of
familiarity in some other time and place As though Lee were saying You know what I mean
You remember
Allerton shrugged irritably and began arranging the chess pieces on the board He looked like a
sullen child unable to locate the source of his ill temper After a few minutes of play his customary
serenity returned and he began humming
It was after midnight when Lee returned to the Ship Ahoy Drunks seethed around the bar talking
as if everyone else were stone deaf Allerton stood on the edge of this group apparently unable
to make himself heard He greeted Lee warmly pushed in to the bar and emerged with two rum
Cokes Lets sit down over here he said
Allerton was drunk His eyes were flushed a faint violet tinge the pupils widely dilated He was
talking very fast in a high thin voice the eerie disembodied voice of a young child Lee had
never heard Allerton talk like this before The effect was like the possession voice of a medium
The boy had an inhuman gaiety and innocence
Allerton was telling a story about his experience with the Counterintelligence Corps in Germany
An informant had been giving the department bum steers
How did you check the accuracy of information Lee asked How did you know ninety percent
of what your informants told you wasnt fabricated
Actually we didnt and we got sucked in on a lot of phony deals Of course we crosschecked all
information with other informants and we had our own agents in the field Most of our informants
turned in some phony information but this one character made all of it up He had our agents out
looking for a whole fictitious network of Russian spies So finally the report comes back from
Frankfurt—it is all a lot of crap But instead of clearing out of town before the information could be
checked he came back with more
At this point wed really had enough of his bullshit So we locked him up in a cellar The room
was pretty cold and uncomfortable but that was all we could do We had to handle prisoners very
careful
He kept typing out confessions enormous things
This story clearly delighted Allerton and he kept laughing while he was telling it Lee was
impressed by his combination of intelligence and childlike charm Allerton was friendly now
without reserve or defense like a child who has never been hurt He was telling another story
Lee watched the thin hands the beautiful violet eyes the flush of excitement on the boys face
An imaginary hand projected with such force it seemed Allerton must feel the touch of
ectoplasmic fingers caressing his ear phantom thumbs smoothing his eyebrows pushing the hair
back from his face Now Lees hands were running down over the ribs the stomach Lee felt the
aching pain of desire in his lungs His mouth was a little open showing his teeth in the halfsnarl
of a baffled animal He licked his lips
Lee did not enjoy frustration The limitations of his desires were like the bars of a cage like a
chain and collar something he had learned as an animal learns through days and years of
experiencing the snub of the chain the unyielding bars He had never resigned himself and his
eyes looked out through the invisible bars watchful alert waiting for the keeper to forget the
door for the frayed collar the loosened bar    suffering without despair and without consent
I went to the door and there he was with a branch in his mouth Allerton was saying
Lee had not been listening A branch in his mouth said Lee then added inanely A big
branch
It was about two feet long I told him to drop dead then a few minutes later he appeared at the
window So I threw a chair at him and he jumped down to the yard from the balcony About
eighteen feet He was very nimble Almost inhuman It was sort of uncanny and thats why I
threw the chair I was scared We all figured he was putting on an act to get out of the Army
What did he look like Lee asked
Look like I dont remember especially He was around eighteen He looked like a cleancut boy
We threw a bucket of cold water on him and left him on a cot downstairs He began flopping
around but he didnt say anything We all decided that was an appropriate punishment I think
they took him to the hospital next day
Pneumonia
I dont know Maybe we shouldnt have thrown water on him
Lee left Allerton at the door of his building
You go in here Lee asked
Yes I have a sack here
Lee said good night and walked home
After that Lee met Allerton every day at five in the Ship Ahoy Allerton was accustomed to
choose his friends from people older than himself and he looked forward to meeting Lee Lee
had conversational routines that Allerton had never heard But he felt at times oppressed by Lee
as though Lees presence shut off everything else He thought he was seeing too much of Lee
Allerton disliked commitments and had never been in love or had a close friend He was now
forced to ask himself What does he want from me It did not occur to him that Lee was queer
as he associated queerness with at least some degree of overt effeminacy He decided finally
that Lee valued him as an audience
At was a beautiful clear afternoon in April Punctually at five Lee walked into the Ship Ahoy
Allerton was at the bar with Al Hyman a periodic alcoholic and one of the nastiest stupidest
dullest drunks Lee had ever known He was on the other hand intelligent and simple in manner
and nice enough when sober He was sober now
Lee had a yellow scarf around his neck and a pair of twopeso sunglasses He took off the scarf
and dark glasses and dropped them on the bar A hard day at the studio he said in affected
theatrical accents He ordered a rum Coke You know it looks like we might bring in an oil well
Theyre drilling now over in quadrangle four and from that rig you could almost spit over into Tex
Mex where I got my hundredacre cotton farm
I always wanted to be an oilman Hyman said
Lee looked him over and shook his head Im afraid not You see it isnt everybody can qualify
You must have the calling First thing you must look like an oilman There are no young oilmen
An oilman should be about fifty His skin is cracked and wrinkled like mud that has dried in the
sun and especially the back of his neck is wrinkled and the wrinkles are generally full of dust
from looking over blocks and quadrangles He wears gabardine slacks and a white shortsleeved
sport shirt His shoes are covered with fine dust and a faint haze of dust follows him everywhere
like a personal dust storm
So you got the calling and the proper appearance You go around taking up leases You get five
or six people lined up to lease you their land for drilling You go to the bank and talk to the
president Now Clem Farris as fine a man as there is in this Valley and smart too hes in this
thing up to his balls and Old Man Scranton and Fred Crockly and Roy Spigot and Ted Bane all
of them good old boys Now let me show you a few facts I could set here and gas all morning
taking up your time but I know youre a man accustomed to deal in facts and figures and thats
exactly what Im here to show you
He goes out to his car always a coupe or a roadster—never saw an oilman with a sedan—and
reaches in hack of the seat and gets out his maps a huge bundle of maps as big as carpets He
spreads them out on the bank presidents desk and great clouds of dust spring up from the maps
and fill the bank You see this quadrangle here Thats TexMex Now theres a fault runs right
along here through Jed Marvins place I saw Old Jed too the other day when I was out there a
good old boy There isnt a finer man in this Valley than Jed Marvin Well now Socony drilled right
over here
He spreads out more maps He pulls over another desk and anchors the maps down with
cuspidors Well they brought in a dry hole and this map    He unrolls another one Now if
youll kindly sit on the other end so it dont roll up on us Ill show you exactly why it was a dry hole
and why they should never have drilled there in the first place cause you can see just where this
here fault runs smack between Jeds artesian well and the TexMex line over into quadrangle
four Now that block was surveyed last time in 1922 I guess you know the old boy done the job
Earl Hoot was his name a good old boy too He had his home up in Nacogdoches but his soninlaw
owned a place down here the old Brooks place up north of TexMex just across the line
from
By this time the president is punchy with boredom and the dust is getting down in his lungsoilmen
are constitutionally immune to the effects of dust—so he says Well if its good enough for
those boys I guess its good enough for me Ill go along
So the oilman goes back and pulls the same routine on his prospects Then he gets a geologist
down from Dallas or somewhere who talks some gibberish about faults and seepage and
intrusions and shale and sand and selects some place more or less at random to start drilling
Now the driller He has to be a real ripsnorting character They look for him in Boys Town—the
whore district in border towns—and they find him in a room full of empty bottles with three
whores So they bust a bottle over his head and drag him out and sober him up and he looks at
the drilling site and spits and says Well its your hole
Now if the well turns out dry the oilman says Well thats the way it goes Some holes got
lubrication and some is dry as a whores cunt on Sunday morning There was one oilman Dry
Hole Dutton they called him—all right Allerton no cracks about Vaseline—brought in twenty dry
holes before he got cured That means get rich in the salty lingo of the oil fraternity
Joe Guidry came in and Lee slid off his stool to shake hands He was hoping Joe would bring up
the subject of queerness so he could gauge Allertons reaction He figured it was time to let
Allerton know what the score was—such a thing as playing it too cool
They sat down at a table Somebody had stolen Guidrys radio his riding boots and wrist watch
The trouble with me is said Guidry I like the type that robs me
Where you make your mistake is bringing them to your apartment Lee said Thats what hotels
are for
Youre right there But half the time I dont have money for a hotel Besides I like someone
around to cook breakfast and sweep the place out
Clean the place out
I dont mind the watch and the radio but it really hurt losing those boots They were a thing of
beauty and a joy forever Guidry leaned forward and glanced at Allerton I dont know whether I
ought to say things like this in front of Junior here No offense kid
Go ahead said Allerton
Did I tell you how I made the cop on the beat
Hes the vigilante the watchman out where I live Every time he sees the light on in my room he
comes in for a shot of rum Well about five nights ago he caught me when I was drunk and
horny and one thing led to another and I ended up showing him how the cow ate the cabbage

So the night after I make him I was walking by the beer joint on the corner and he comes out
borracho and says Have a drink I said I dont want a drink So he takes out his pistola and
says Have a drink I proceeded to take his pistola away from him and he goes into the beer
joint to phone for reinforcements So I had to go in and rip the phone off the wall Now theyre
billing me for the phone When I got back to my room which is on the ground floor he had written
El Puto Gringo on the window with soap So instead of wiping it off I left it there It pays to
advertise
The drinks kept coming Allerton went to the WC and got in a conversation at the bar when he
returned Guidry was accusing Hyman of being queer and pretending not to be Lee was trying to
explain to Guidry that Hyman wasnt really queer and Guidry said to him Hes queer and you
arent Lee You just go around pretending youre queer to get in on the act
Who wants to get in on your tired old act Lee said He saw Allerton at the bar talking to John
Dumé
Dume belonged to a small clique of queers who made their headquarters in a beer joint on
Campeche called The Green Lantern Dumé himself was not an obvious queer but the other
Green Lantern boys were screaming fags who would not have been welcome at the Ship Ahoy
Lee walked over to the bar and started talking to the bartender He thought I hope Dumé tells
him about me Lee felt uncomfortable in dramatic somethingIhavetotellyou routines and he
knew from unnerving experience the difficulties of a casual comeon Im queer you know by
the way Sometimes they dont hear right and yell What Or you toss in If you were as queer
as I am The other yawns and changes the subject and you dont know whether he understood
or not
The bartender was saying She asks me why I drink What can I tell her I dont know why Why
did you have the monkey on your back Do you know why There isnt any why but try to explain
that to someone like Jerri Try to explain that to any woman Lee nodded sympathetically She
says to me why dont you get more sleep and eat better She dont understand and I cant
explain it Nobody can explain it
The bartender moved away to wait on some customers Dumé came over to Lee How do you
like this character he said indicating Allerton with a wave of his beer bottle Allerton was across
the room talking to Mary and a chess player from Peru He comes to me and says I thought you
were one of the Green Lantern boys So I said Well I am He wants me to take him around to
some of the gay places here
Lee and Allerton went to see Cocteaus Orpheus In the dark theater Lee could feel his body pull
towards Allerton an amoeboid protoplasmic projection straining with a blind worm hunger to
enter the others body to breathe with his lungs see with his eyes learn the feel of his viscera
and genitals Allerton shifted in his seat Lee felt a sharp twinge a strain or dislocation of the
spirit His eyes ached He took off his glasses and ran his hand over his closed eyes
When they left the theater Lee felt exhausted He fumbled and bumped into things His voice was
toneless with strain He put his hand up to his head from time to time an awkward involuntary
gesture of pain I need a drink he said He pointed to a bar across the street There he said
He sat down in a booth and ordered a double tequila Allerton ordered rum and Coke Lee drank
the tequila straight down listening down into himself for the effect He ordered another
What did you think of the picture Lee asked
Enjoyed parts of it
Yes Lee nodded pursing his lips and looking down into his empty glass So did I He
pronounced the words very carefully like an elocution teacher
He always gets some innaresting effects Lee laughed Euphoria was spreading from his
stomach He drank half the second tequila The innaresting thing about Cocteau is his ability to
bring the myth alive in modern terms
Aint it the truth said Allerton
They went to a Russian restaurant for dinner Lee looked through the menu By the way he
said the law was in putting the bite on the Ship Ahoy again Vice squad Two hundred pesos I
can see them in the station house after a hard day shaking down citizens of the Federal District
One cop says Ah Gonzalez you should see what I got today Oh la la such a bite
Aah you shook down a puto queer for two pesetas in a bus station crapper We know you
Hernandez and your cheap tricks Youre the cheapest cop inna Federal District
Lee waved to the waiter Hey Jack Dos martinis much dry Seco And dos plates Sheeshka
Babe Saben
The waiter nodded Thats two dry martinis and two orders of shish kebab Right gentlemen
Solid Pops    So how was your evening with Dumé
We went to several bars full of queers One place a character asked me to dance and
propositioned me
Take him up
No
Dumé is a nice fellow
Allerton smiled Yes but he is not a person I would confide too much in That is anything I
wanted to keep private
You refer to a specific indiscretion
Frankly yes
I see Lee thought Dumé never misses
The waiter put two martinis on the table Lee held his martini up to the candle looking at it with
distaste The inevitable watery martini with a decomposing olive he said
Lee bought a lottery ticket from a boy of ten or so who had rushed in when the waiter went to the
kitchen The boy was working the lastticket routine Lee paid him expansively like a drunk
American
Go buy yourself some marijuana son he said The boy smiled and turned to leave Come back
in five years and make an easy ten pesos Lee called after him
Allerton smiled Thank god Lee thought I wont have to contend with middleclass morality
Here you are sir said the waiter placing the shish kebab on the table
Lee ordered two glasses of red wine So Dumé told you about my uh proclivities he said
abruptly
Yes said Allerton his mouth full
A curse Been in our family for generations The Lees have always been perverts I shall never
forget the unspeakable horror that froze the lymph in my glands—the lymph glands that is of
course— when the baneful word seared my reeling brain I was a homosexual I thought of the
painted simpering female impersonators I had seen in a Baltimore night club Could it be
possible that I was one of those subhuman things I walked the streets in a daze like a man with
a light concussion—just a minute Doctor Kildare this isnt your script I might well have
destroyed myself ending an existence which seemed to offer nothing but grotesque misery and
humiliation Nobler I thought to die a man than live on a sex monster It was a wise old queen—
Bobo we called her—who taught me that I had a duty to live and to bear my burden proudly for
all to see to conquer prejudice and ignorance and hate with knowledge and sincerity and love
Whenever you are threatened by a hostile presence you emit a thick cloud of love like an
octopus squirts out ink
Poor Bobo came to a sticky end He was riding in the Duc de Ventres HispanoSuiza when his
falling piles blew out of the car and wrapped around the rear wheel He was completely gutted
leaving an empty shell sitting there on the giraffeskin upholstery Even the eyes and the brain
went with a horrible shlupping sound The Duc says he will carry that ghastly shlup with him to
his mausoleum
Then I knew the meaning of loneliness But Bobos words came back to me from the tomb the
sibilants cracking gently No one is ever really alone You are part of everything alive The
difficulty is to convince someone else he is really part of you so what the hell Us parts ought to
work together Reet
Lee paused looking at Allerton speculatively Just where do I stand with the kid he wondered
He had listened politely smiling at intervals What I mean is Allerton we are all parts of a
tremendous whole No use fighting it Lee was getting tired of the routine He looked around
restlessly for some place to put it down Dont these gay bars depress you Of course the queer
bars here arent to compare with Stateside queer joints
I wouldnt know said Allerton Ive never been in any queer joints except those Dumé took me
to I guess theres kicks and kicks
You havent really
No never
Lee paid the bill and they walked out into the cool night A crescent moon was clear and green in
the sky They walked aimlessly
Shall we go to my place for a drink I have some Napoleon brandy
All right said AUerton
This is a completely unpretentious little brandy you understand none of this tourist treacle with
obvious effects of flavoring appealing to the mass tongue My brandy has no need of shoddy
devices to shock and coerce the palate Come along Lee called a cab
Three pesos to Insurgentes and Monterrey Lee said to the driver in his atrocious Spanish The
driver said four Lee waved him on The driver muttered something and opened the door
Inside Lee turned to Allerton The man plainly harbors subversive thoughts You know when I
was at Princeton Communism was the thing To come out flat for private property and a class
society you marked yourself a stupid lout or suspect to be a High Episcopalian pederast But I
held out against the infection—of Communism I mean of course
Aquí Lee handed three pesos to the driver who muttered some more and started the car with a
vicious clash of gears
Sometimes I think they dont like us said Allerton
I dont mind people disliking me Lee said The question is what are they in a position to do
about it Apparently nothing at present They dont have the green light This driver for example
hates gringos But if he kills someone—and very possibly he will—it will not be an American It
will be another Mexican Maybe his good friend Friends are less frightening than strangers
Lee opened the door of his apartment and turned on the light The apartment was pervaded by
seemingly hopeless disorder Here and there ineffectual attempts had been made to arrange
things in piles There were no livedin touches No pictures no decorations Clearly none of the
furniture was his But Lees presence permeated the apartment A coat over the back of a chair
and a hat on the table were immediately recognizable as belonging to Lee
Ill fix you a drink Lee got two water glasses from the kitchen and poured two inches of Mexican
brandy in each glass
Allerton tasted the brandy Good Lord he said Napoleon must have pissed in this one
I was afraid of that An untutored palate Your generation has never learned the pleasures that a
trained palate confers on the disciplined few
Lee took a long drink of the brandy He attempted an ecstatic aah inhaled some of the brandy
and began to cough It is godawful he said when he could talk Still better than California
brandy It has a suggestion of cognac taste
There was a long silence Allerton was sitting with his head leaning back against the couch His
eyes were half closed
Can I show you over the house said Lee standing up In here we have the bedroom
Allerton got to his feet slowly They went into the bedroom and Allerton lay down on the bed and
lit a cigarette Lee sat in the only chair
More brandy Lee asked Allerton nodded Lee sat down on the edge of the bed and filled his
glass and handed it to him Lee touched his sweater Sweet stuff dearie he said That wasnt
made in Mexico
I bought it in Scotland he said He began to hiccough violently and got up and rushed for the
bathroom
Lee stood in the doorway Too bad he said
What could be the matter You didnt drink much He filled a glass with water and handed it to
Allerton You all right now he asked
Yes I think so Allerton lay down on the bed again
Lee reached out a hand and touched Allertons ear and caressed the side of his face Allerton
reached up and covered one of Lees hands and squeezed it
Lets get this sweater off
OK said Allerton He took off the sweater and then lay down again Lee took off his own shoes
and shirt He opened Allertons shirt and ran his hand down Allertons ribs and stomach which
contracted beneath his fingers God youre skinny he said
Im pretty small
Lee took off Allertons shoes and socks He loosened Allertons belt and unbuttoned his trousers
Allerton arched his body and Lee pulled the trousers and drawers off He dropped his own
trousers and shorts and lay down beside him Allerton responded without hostility or disgust but
in his eyes Lee saw a curious detachment the impersonal calm of an animal or a child
Later when they lay side by side smoking Lee said Oh by the way you said you had a camera
in pawn you were about to lose It occurred to Lee that to bring the matter up at this time was
not tactful but he decided the other was not the type to take offense
Yes In for four hundred pesos The ticket runs out next Wednesday
Well lets go down tomorrow and get it out Allerton raised one bare shoulder off the sheet
OKhe said
Friday night Allerton went to work He was taking his roommates place proofreading for an
English newspaper
Saturday night Lee met Allerton in the Cuba a bar with an interior like the set for a surrealist
ballet The walls were covered with murals depicting underwater scenes Mermaids and mermen
in elaborate arrangements with huge goldfish stared at the customers with fixed identical
expressions of pathic dismay Even the fish were invested with an air of ineffectual alarm The
effect was disquieting as though these androgynous beings were frightened by something behind
or to one side of the customers who were made uneasy by this inferred presence Most of them
took their business someplace else
Allerton was somewhat sullen and Lee felt depressed and ill at ease until he had put down two
martinis You know Allerton     he said after a long silence Allerton was humming to himself
drumming on the table and looking around restlessly Now he stopped humming and raised an
eyebrow
This punk is getting too smart Lee thought He knew he had no way of punishing him for
indifference or insolence
They have the most incompetent tailors in Mexico I have encountered in all my experience as a
traveller Have you had any work done Lee looked pointedly at Allertons shabby clothes He
was as careless of his clothes as Lee was Apparently not Take this tailor Im hung up with
Simple job I bought a pair of readymade trousers Never took time for a fitting Both of us could
get in those pants
It wouldnt look right said Allerton
People would think we were Siamese twins Did I ever tell you about the Siamese twin who
turned his brother in to the law to get him off the junk But to get back to this tailor I took the
pants in with another pair These pants is too voluminous I told him I want them sewed down to
the same size as this other pair here He promised to do the job in two days That was more than
two months ago Mañana más tarde ahora ahorita and every time I come to pick up the
pants its todavía no—not yet Yesterday I had all the ahora routine I can stand still for So I told
him Ready or no give me my pants The pants was all cut down the seams I told him Two
months and all you have done is disembowel my trousers I took them to another tailor and told
him Sew them up Are you hungry
I am as a matter of fact
How about Pats Steak House
Good idea
Pats served excellent steaks Lee liked the place because it was never crowded At Pats he
ordered a double dry martini Allerton had rum and Coke Lee began talking about telepathy
I know telepathy to be a fact since I have experienced it myself I have no interest to prove it or
in fact to prove anything to anybody What interests me is how can I use it In South America at
the headwaters of the Amazon grows a plant called Yage that is supposed to increase telepathic
sensitivity Medicine men use it in their work A Colombian scientist whose name escapes me
isolated from Yage a drug he called Telepathine I read all this in a magazine article
Later I see another article—the Russians are using Yage in experiments on slave labor It seems
they want to induce states of automatic obedience and ultimately of course thought control The
basic con No buildup no spiel no routine just move in on someones psyche and give orders I
have a theory the Mayan priests developed a form of oneway telepathy to con the peasants into
doing all the work The deal is certain to backfire eventually because telepathy is not of its nature
a oneway setup nor a setup of sender and receiver at all
By now the US is experimenting with Yage unless they are dumber even than I think Yage
may be a means to usable knowledge of telepathy Anything that can be accomplished
chemically can be accomplished in other ways Lee saw that Allerton was not especially
interested and dropped the subject
Did you read about the old Jew who tried to smuggle out ten pounds of gold sewed in his
overcoat
No What about it
Well this old Jew was nailed at the airport on his way to Cuba I hear they got like a mine finder
out at the airport rings a bell if anybody passes the gate with an outlandish quantity of metal on
his person So it says in the papers after they give this Jew a shake and find the gold a large
number of Jewishlooking foreigners were seen looking into the airport window in a state of
excitement Oy gefilte fish They are putting the snatch on Abe Back in Roman times the Jews
rose up—in Jerusalem I think it was—and killed fifty thousand Romans The sheJews—that is
the young Jewish ladies I must be careful not to lay myself open to a charge of antiSemitism—
done strip teases with Roman intestines
Speaking of intestines did I ever tell you about my friend Reggie One of the unsung heroes of
British Intelligence Lost his ass and ten feet of lower intestine in the service Lived for years
disguised as an Arab boy known only as Number 69 at headquarters That was wishful thinking
though because the Arabs are strictly one way Well a rare Oriental disease set in and poor
Reggie lost the bulk of his tripes For God and country what He didnt want any speeches any
medals just to know that he had served that was enough Think of those patient years waiting
for another piece of the jigsaw puzzle to fall into place
You never hear of operators like Reggie but it is their information gathered in pain and danger
that gives some frontline general the plan for a brilliant counteroffensive and covers his chest
with medals For example Reggie was the first to guess the enemy was running short of petrol
when the K Y jelly gave out and that was only one of his brilliant coups How about the Tbone
steak for two
Thats fine
Rare
Medium rare
Lee was looking at the menu They list baked Alaska he said Ever eat it
No
Real good Hot on the outside and cold inside
Thats why they call it baked Alaska I imagine
Got an idea for a new dish Take a live pig and throw it into a very hot oven so the pig is roasted
outside and when you cut into it its still alive and twitching inside Or if we run a dramatic joint a
screaming pig covered with burning brandy rushes out of the kitchen and dies right by your chair
You can reach down and pull off the crispy crackly ears and eat them with your cocktails
Outside the City lay under a violet haze A warm spring wind blew through the trees in the park
They walked through the park back to Lees place occasionally stopping to lean against each
other weak from laughing A Mexican said Cabrones as he walked by Lee called after him
Chinga tu madre then added in English Here I come to your little jerkwater country and spend
my good American dollars and what happens Insulted inna public street The Mexican turned
hesitating Lee unbuttoned his coat and hooked his thumb under the pistol at his waistband The
Mexican walked on
Someday they wont walk away said Lee
At Lees apartment they had some brandy Lee put his arm around Allertons shoulder
Well if you insist said Allerton
Sunday night Allerton had dinner at Lees apartment Lee cooked chicken livers because Allerton
always wanted to order chicken liver in restaurants and usually restaurant chicken liver isnt
fresh After dinner Lee began making love to Allerton but he rejected Lees advances and said he
wanted to go to the Ship Ahoy and drink a rum Coke Lee turned out the light and embraced
Allerton before they started out the door Allertons body was rigid with annoyance
When they arrived at the Ship Ahoy Lee went to the bar and ordered two rum Cokes Make
those extra strong he said to the bartender
Allerton was sitting at a table with Mary Lee brought the rum Coke over and set it down by
Allerton Then he sat down at a table with Joe Guidry Joe Guidry had a young man with him The
young man was telling how he was treated by an Army psychiatrist So what did you find out
from your psychiatrist said Guidry His voice had a nagging derogatory edge
I found out I was an Oedipus I found out I love my mother
Why everybody loves their mother son said Guidry
I mean I love my mother physically
I dont believe that son said Guidry This struck Lee as funny and he began to laugh
I hear Jim Cochan has gone back to the States said Guidry He plans to work in Alaska
Thank God I am a gentleman of independent means and dont have to expose myself to the
inclemencies of nearArctic conditions said Lee By the way did you ever meet Jims wife
Alice My god she is an American bitch that wont quit I never yet see her equal Jim does not
have one friend he can take to the house She has forbidden him to eat out as she does not want
he should take in any nourishment unless she is there to watch him eat it Did you ever hear the
likes of that Needless to say my place is out of bounds to Jim and he always has that hunted
look when he comes to see me I dont know why American men put up with such shit from a
woman
Of course I am no expert judge of female flesh but Alice has lousy lay writ all over her scrawny
unappetizing person
Youre coming on mighty bitchy tonight Lee said Guidry
And not without reason Did I tell you about this Wigg person He is an American hipster around
town a junky who is said to play a cool bass fiddle Strictly on the chisel even though he has
gold and hes always mooching junk saying No I dont want to buy any Im kicking I just want
half a fix I have had all I can stand still for from this character Driving around in a new threethousand
dollar Chrysler and too cheap to buy his own junk What am I the Junkys Benevolent
Society for christ sake This Wigg is as ugly as people get
You making it with him asked Guidry which seemed to shock his young friend
Not even I got bigger fish to fry said Lee He glanced over at Allerton who was laughing at
something Mary had said
Fish is right quipped Guidry Cold slippery and hard to catch
Lee had an appointment with Allerton for eleven oclock Monday morning to go to the National
Pawn Shop and get his camera out of hock Lee came to Allertons room and woke him up
exactly at eleven Allerton was sullen He seemed on the point of going back to sleep Finally Lee
said Well are you going to get up now or
Allerton opened his eyes and blinked like a turtle Im getting up he said
Lee sat down and read a newspaper careful to avoid watching Allerton dress He was trying to
control his hurt and anger and the effort exhausted him A heavy drag slowed movement and
thought Lees face was rigid his voice toneless The strain continued through breakfast Alierton
sipped tomato juice in silence
It took all day to get the camera Alierton had lost the ticket They went from one office to another
The officials shook their heads and drummed on the table waiting Lee put out two hundred
pesos extra in bites He finally paid the four hundred pesos plus interest and various charges He
handed the camera to Alierton who took it without comment
They went back to the Ship Ahoy in silence Lee went in and ordered a drink Alierton
disappeared About an hour later he came in and sat with Lee
How about dinner tonight asked Lee
Allerton said No I think Ill work tonight
Lee was depressed and shattered The warmth and laughter of Saturday night was lost and he
did not know why In any relation of love or friendship Lee attempted to establish contact on the
nonverbal level of intuition a silent exchange of thought and feeling Now Alierton had abruptly
shut off contact and Lee felt a physical pain as though a part of himself tentatively stretched out
towards the other had been severed and he was looking at the bleeding stump in shock and
disbelief
Lee said Like the Wallace administration I subsidize nonproduction I will pay you twenty pesos
not to work tonight Lee was about to develop the idea but Allertons impatient coolness stopped
him He fell silent looking at Allerton with shocked hurt eyes
Allerton was nervous and irritable drumming on the table and looking around He did not himself
understand why Lee annoyed him
How about a drink Lee said
No Not now Anyway I have to go
Lee got up jerkily Well Ill see you he said Ill see you tomorrow
Yes Good night
He left Lee standing there trying to formulate a plan to keep Allerton from going to make an
appointment for the next day to mitigate in some way the hurt he had received
Allerton was gone Lee felt for the back of his chair and lowered himself into it like a man weak
from illness He stared at the table his thoughts slow as if he were very cold
The bartender placed a sandwich in front of Lee Huh said Lee Whats this
The sandwich you ordered
Oh yes Lee took a few bites out of the sandwich washing it down with water On my bill Joe
he called to the bartender
He got up and walked out He walked slowly Several times he leaned on a tree looking at the
ground as if his stomach hurt Inside his apartment he took off his coat and shoes and sat down
on the bed His throat began to ache moisture hit his eyes and he fell across the bed sobbing
convulsively He pulled his knees up and covered his face with his hands the fists clenched
Towards morning he turned on his back and stretched out The sobs stopped and his face
relaxed in the morning light
Lee woke up around noon and sat for a long time on the edge of the bed with one shoe dangling
from his hand He dabbed water on his eyes put on his coat and went out
Lee went down to the Zócalo and wandered around for several hours His mouth was dry He
went into a Chinese restaurant sat down in a booth and ordered a Coke Misery spread through
his body now that he was sitting down with no motion to distract him What happened he
wondered
He forced himself to look at the facts Allerton was not queer enough to make a reciprocal relation
possible Lees affection irritated him Like many people who have nothing to do he was resentful
of any claims on his time He had no close friends He disliked definite appointments He did not
like to feel that anybody expected anything from him He wanted so far as possible to live
without external pressure Allerton resented Lees action in paying to recover the camera He felt
he was being sucked in on a phony deal and that an obligation he did not want had been thrust
upon him
Allerton did not recognize friends who made sixhundredpeso gifts nor could he feel comfortable
exploiting Lee He made no attempt to clarify the situation He did not want to see the
contradiction involved in resenting a favor which he accepted Lee found that he could tune in on
Allertons viewpoint though the process caused him pain since it involved seeing the extent of
Allertons indifference I liked him and I wanted him to like me Lee thought I wasnt trying to
buy anything
I have to leave town he decided Go somewhere Panama South America He went down to
the station to find out when the next train left for Veracruz There was a train that night but he did
not buy a ticket A feeling of cold desolation came over him at the thought of arriving alone in
another country far away from Allerton
Lee took a cab to the Ship Ahoy Allerton was not there and Lee sat at the bar for three hours
drinking Finally Allerton looked in the door waved to Lee vaguely and went upstairs with Mary
Lee knew they had probably gone to the owners apartment where they often ate dinner
He went up to Tom Westons apartment Mary and Allerton were there Lee sat down and tried to
engage Allertons interest but he was too drunk to make sense His attempt to carry on a casual
humorous conversation was painful to watch
Ale must have slept Mary and Allerton were gone Tom Weston brought him some hot coffee He
drank the coffee got up and staggered out of the apartment Exhausted he slept till the following
morning
Scenes from the chaotic drunken month passed before his eyes There was a face he did not
recognize a goodlooking kid with amber eyes yellow hair and beautiful straight black eyebrows
He saw himself asking someone he barely knew to buy him a beer in a bar on Insurgentes and
getting a nasty brush He saw himself pull a gun on someone who followed him out of a clip joint
on Coahuila and tried to roll him He felt the friendly steadying hands of people who had helped
him home Take it easy Bill His childhood friend Rollins standing there solid and virile with his
elkhound Carl running for a streetcar Moor with his malicious hitch smile The faces blended
together in a nightmare speaking to him in strange moaning idiot voices that he could not
understand at first and finally could not hear
Lee got up and shaved and felt better He found he could eat a roll and drink some coffee He
smoked and read the paper trying not to think about Allerton Presently he went downtown and
looked through the gun stores He found a bargain in a Colt Frontier which he bought for two
hundred pesos A 3220 in perfect condition serial number in the three hundred thousands
Worth at least a hundred dollars Stateside
Lee went to the American bookstore and bought a book on chess He took the book out to
Chapultepec sat down in a soda stand on the lagoon and began to read Directly in front of him
was an island with a huge cypress tree growing on it Hundreds of vultures roosted in the tree
Lee wondered what they ate He threw a piece of bread which landed on the island The vultures
paid no attention
Lee was interested in the theory of games and the strategy of random behavior As he had
supposed the theory of games does not apply to chess since chess rules out the element of
chance and approaches elimination of the unpredictable human factor If the mechanism of chess
were completely understood the outcome could be predicted after any initial move A game for
thinking machines Lee thought He read on smiling from time to time Finally he got up sailed
the book out over the lagoon and walked away
Lee knew he could not find what he wanted with Allerton The court of fact had rejected his
petition But Lee could not give up Perhaps I can discover a way to change fact he thought He
was ready to take any risk to proceed to any extreme of action Like a saint or a wanted criminal
with nothing to lose Lee had stepped beyond the claims of his nagging cautious aging
frightened flesh
He took a taxi to the Ship Ahoy Allerton was standing in front of the Ship Ahoy blinking
sluggishly in the sunlight Lee looked at him and smiled Allerton smiled back
How are you
Sleepy Just got up He yawned and started into the Ship Ahoy He moved one hand—See
you— and sat down at the bar and ordered tomato juice Lee went in and sat beside him and
ordered a double rum Coke Allerton moved and sat down at a table with Tom Weston Bring the
tomato juice over here will you Joe he called to the bartender
Lee sat at the table next to Allertons Tom Weston was leaving Allerton followed him out He
came back in and sat in the other room reading the papers Mary came in and sat down with him
After talking for a few minutes they set up the chess board
Lee had thrown down three drinks He walked over and pulled up a chair to the table where Mary
and Allerton were playing chess Howdy he said Dont mind if I kibitz
Mary looked up annoyed but smiled when she met Lees steady reckless gaze
I was reading up on chess Arabs invented it and Im not surprised Nobody can sit like an Arab
The classical Arab chess game was simply a sitting contest When both contestants starved to
death it was a stalemate Lee paused and took a long drink
During the Baroque period of chess the practice of harrying your opponent with some annoying
mannerism came into general use Some players used dental floss others cracked their joints or
blew saliva bubbles The method was constantly developed In the 1917 match at Baghdad the
Arab Arachnid Khayam defeated the German master Kurt Schlemiel by humming Ill Be Around
When Youre Gone fortythousand times and each time reaching his hand towards the board as
if he intended to make a move Schlemiel went into convulsions finally
Did you ever have the good fortune to see the Italian master Tetrazzini perform Lee lit Marys
cigarette I say perform advisedly because he was a great showman and like all showmen not
above charlatanism and at times downright trickery Sometimes he used smoke screens to hide
his maneuvers from the opposition—I mean literal smoke screens of course He had a corps of
trained idiots who would rush in at a given signal and eat all the pieces With defeat staring him in
the face—as it often did because actually he knew nothing of chess but the rules and wasnt too
sure of those—he would leap up yelling You cheap bastard I saw you palm that queen and
ram a broken teacup into his opponents face In 1922 he was rid out of Prague on a rail The
next time I saw Tetrazzini was in the Upper Ubangi A complete wreck Peddling unlicensed
condoms That was the year of the rinderpest when everything died even the hyenas
Lee paused The routine was coming to him like dictation He did not know what he was going to
say next but he suspected the monologue was about to get dirty He looked at Mary She was
exchanging significant glances with Allerton Some sort of lover code Lee decided She is
telling him they have to go now Allerton got up saying he had to have a haircut before going to
work Mary and Allerton left Lee was alone in the bar
The monologue continued I was working as Aidedecamp under General Von Klutch Exacting
A hard man to satisfy I gave up trying after the first week We had a saying around the
wardroom Never expose your flank to old Klutchy Well I couldnt take Klutchy another night so
I assembled a modest caravan and hit the trail with Abdul the local Adonis Ten miles out of
Tanhajaro Abdul came down with the rinderpest and I had to leave him there to die Hated to do
it but there was no other way Lost his looks completely you understand
At the headwaters of the Zambesi I ran into an old Dutch trader After considerable haggling I
gave him a keg of paregoric for a boy half Effendi and half Lulu I figured the boy would get me
as far as Timbuktu maybe all the way to Dakar But the LuluEffendi was showing signs of wear
even before I hit Timbuktu and I decided to trade him in on a straight Bedouin model The
crossbreeds make a good appearance but they dont hold up In Timbuktu I went to Corn Hole
Guss UsedSlave Lot to see what he could do for me on a tradein
Gus rushes out and goes into the spiel Ah Sahib Lee Allah has sent you I have something
right up your ass I mean alley Just came in One owner and he was a doctor A onceoverlightly
twiceaweektype citizen Its young and its tender In fact it talks baby talk    behold
You call those senile slobberings baby talk My grandfather got a clap off that one Come again
Gussie
You do not like it A pity Well everyone has a taste feller say Now here I have a onehundredpercent
desertbred Bedouin with a pedigree goes straight back to the Prophet Dig his bearing
Such pride Such fire
A good appearance job Gus but not good enough Its an albino Mongolian idiot Look Gussie
you are dealing with the oldest faggot in the Upper Ubangi so come off the peg Reach down into
your grease pit and dredge out the bestlooking punk you got in this motheaten bazaar
All right Sahib Lee you want quality right Follow me please Here it is What can I say
Quality speaks for itself Now I get a lotta cheaptype customers in here wanna see quality and
then scream at the price But you know and I know that quality runs high As a matter of fact and
this I swear by the Prophets prick I lose money on this quality merchandise
Uh huh Got some hidden miles on him but hell do How about a trial run
Lee for christ sake I dont run a house This joint is strictly package No consumption on
premises I could lose my license
I dont aim to get caught short with one of your Scotchtape and householdcement
reconditioned jobs a hundred miles from the nearest Soukh Besides how do I know it aint a
Liz
Sahib Lee This is an ethical lot
I was beat that way one time in Marrakesh Citizen passed a transvestite Jew Lizzie on me as
an Abyssinian prince
Ha ha ha full of funny jokes arent you How is this stay over in town tonight and try it out If
you dont want it in the morning I refund every piaster Fair enough
O K now what can you give me on this LuluEffendi Perfect condition Just overhauled He
dont eat much and he dont say nothing
Jesus Lee You know Id cut off my right nut for you but I swear by my mothers cunt may I fall
down and be paralyzed and my prick fall off if these mixed jobs aint harder to move than a
junkys bowels
Skip the routine How much Gus stands in front of the LuluEffendi with his hands on his hips
He smiles and shakes his head He walks around the boy He reaches in and points to a small
slightly varicose vein behind the knee Look at that he says still smiling and shaking his head
He walks around again    Got piles too He shakes his head I dont know I really dont know
what to say to you Open up kid    Two teeth missing Gus has stopped smiling He is talking
in low considerate tones like an undertaker
Im going to be honest with you Lee Ive got a lotful of this stuff now Id rather just forget this
job and talk cash on the other
What am I going to do with it Peddle it on the public street
Might take it along as a spare Ha ha
Ha What can you give me
Well    now dont get mad    two hundred piasters Gus makes a skittish little run as if to
escape my anger and throws up a huge cloud of dust in the courtyard
The routine ended suddenly and Lee looked around The bar was nearly empty He paid for his
drinks and walked out into the night
Thursday Lee went to the races on the recommendation of Tom Weston Weston was an
amateur astrologer and he assured Lee the signs were right Lee lost five races and took a taxi
back to the Ship Ahoy
Mary and Allerton were sitting at a table with the Peruvian chess player Allerton asked Lee to
come over and sit down at the table
Wheres that phony whore caster Lee said looking around
Tom give you a bum steer asked Allerton
He did that
Mary left with the Peruvian Lee finished his third drink and turned to Allerton I figure to go down
to South America soon he said Why dont you come along Wont cost you a cent
Perhaps not in money
Im not a difficult man to get along with We could reach a satisfactory arrangement What you
got to lose
Independence
So whos going to cut in on your independence You can lay all the women in South America if
you want to All I ask is be nice to Papa say twice a week That isnt excessive is it Besides I
will buy you a roundtrip ticket so you can leave at your discretion
Allerton shrugged Ill think it over he said This job runs ten days more Ill give you a definite
answer when the job folds
Your job    Lee was about to say Ill give you ten days salary He said All right
Allertons newspaper job was temporary and he was too lazy to hold a job in any case
Consequently his answer meant No Lee figured to talk him over in ten days Better not force
the issue now he thought
Allerton planned a threeday trip to Morelia with his coworkers in the newspaper office The night
before he left Lee was in a state of manic excitement He collected a noisy table full of people
Allerton was playing chess with Mary and Lee made all the noise he could He kept his table
laughing but they all looked vaguely uneasy as if they would prefer to be someplace else They
thought Lee was a little crazy But just when he seemed on the point of some scandalous excess
of speech or behavior he would check himself and say something completely banal
Lee leaped up to embrace a new arrival Ricardo Amigo mío he said Havent seen you in a
dogs age Where you been Having a baby Sit down on your ass or whats left of it after four
years in the Navy Whats troubling you Richard Is it women Im glad you came to me instead
of those quacks on the top floor
At this point Allerton and Mary left after consulting for a moment in low tones Lee looked after
them in silence Im playing to an empty house now he thought He ordered another rum and
swallowed four Benzedrine tablets Then he went into the head and smoked a roach of tea Now
I will ravish my public he thought
The busboy had caught a mouse and was holding it up by the tail Lee pulled out an oldfashioned
22 revolver he sometimes carried Hold the son of a bitch out and Ill blast it he said
striking a Napoleonic pose The boy tied a string to the mouses tail and held it out at arms
length Lee fired from a distance of three feet His bullet tore the mouses head off
If youd got any closer the mouse would have clogged the muzzle said Richard
Tom Weston came in Here comes the old whore caster Lee said That retrograde Saturn
dragging your ass man
My ass is dragging because I need a beer said Weston
Well youve come to the right place A beer for my astrologizing friend    Whats that Im
sorry old man Lee said turning to Weston but the bartender say the signs arent right to serve
you a beer You see Venus is in the sixtyninth house with a randy Neptune and he couldnt let
you have a beer under such auspices Lee washed down a small piece of opium with black
coffee
Horace walked in and gave Lee his brief cold nod Lee rushed over and embraced him This
thing is bigger than both of us Horace he said Why hide our love
Horace thrust out his arms rigidly Knock it off he said Knock it off
Just a Mexican abrazo Horace Custom of the country Everyone does it down here
I dont care what the custom is Just keep away from me
Horace Why are you so cold
Horace said Knock it off will you and walked out A little later he came back and stood at the
end of the bar drinking a beer
Weston and Al and Richard came over and stood with Lee Were with you Bill Weston said If
he lays a finger on you Ill break a beer bottle over his head
Lee did not want to push the routine past a joking stage He said Oh Horace is okay I guess
But theres a limit to what I can stand still for Two years he hands me these curt nods Two years
he walks into Lolas and looks around—Nothing in here but fags he says and goes out on the
street to drink his beer Like I say there is a limit
Allerton came back from his trip to Morelia sullen and irritable When Lee asked if he had a good
trip he muttered Oh all right and went in the other room to play chess with Mary Lee felt a
charge of anger pass through his body Ill make him pay for this somehow he thought
Lee considered buying a halfinterest in the Ship Ahoy Allerton existed on credit at the Ship
Ahoy and owed four hundred pesos If Lee was halfowner of the joint Allerton would not be in a
position to ignore him Lee did not actually want retaliation He felt a desperate need to maintain
some special contact with Allerton
Lee managed to reestablish contact One afternoon Lee and Allerton went to visit Al Hyman who
was in the hospital with jaundice On the way home they stopped in the Bottoms Up for a cocktail
What about this trip to South America Lee said abruptly
Well its always nice to see places you havent seen before said Allerton
Can you leave anytime
Anytime
Next day Lee started collecting the necessary visas and tickets Better buy some camping
equipment here he said We may have to trek back into the jungle to find the Yage When we
get where the Yage is well dig a hip cat and ask him Where can we score for Yage
How will you know where to look for the Yage I aim to find that out in Bogotá A Colombian
scientist who lives in Bogotá isolated Telepathine from Yage We must find that scientist
Suppose he wont talk
They all talk when Boris goes to work on them
You Boris
Certainly not We pick up Boris in Panama He did excellent work with the Reds in Barcelona
and with the Gestapo in Poland A talented man All his work has the Boris touch Light but
persuasive A mild little fellow with spectacles Looks like a bookkeeper I met him in a Turkish
bath in Budapest
A blond Mexican boy went by pushing a cart Jesus Christ Lee said his mouth dropping open
One of them blondheaded Mexicans Taint as if it was being queer Allerton After all theys
only Mexicans Lets have a drink
They left by bus a few days later and by the time they reached Panama City Allerton was
already complaining that Lee was too demanding in his desires Otherwise they got on very well
Now that Lee could spend days and nights with the object of his attentions he felt relieved of the
gnawing emptiness and fear And Allerton was a good travelling companion sensible and calm
They flew from Panama to Quito in a tiny plane which had to struggle to climb above an
overcast The steward plugged in the oxygen Lee sniffed the oxygen hose Its cut he said in
disgust
They drove into Quito in a windy cold twilight The hotel looked a hundred years old The room
had a high ceiling with black beams and white piaster walls They sat on the beds shivering Lee
was a little junk sick
They walked around the main square Lee hit a drugstore—no paregoric without a script A cold
wind from the high mountains blew rubbish through the dirty streets The people walked by in
gloomy silence Many had blankets wrapped around their faces A row of hideous old hags
huddled in dirty blankets that looked like old burlap sacks were ranged along the walls of a
church
Now son I want you to know I am different from other citizens you might run into Some people
will give you the womenarenogood routine Im not like that You just pick yourself one of these
señoritas and take her right hack to the hotel with you
Allerton looked at him I think I will get laid tonight he said
Sure Lee said Go right ahead They dont have much pulchritude in this dump but that hadnt
oughta deter you young fellers Was it Frank Harris said he never saw an ugly woman till he was
thirty It was as a matter of fact    Lets go back to the hotel and have a drink
The bar was drafty Oak chairs with black leather seats They ordered martinis At the next table a
redfaced American in an expensive brown gabardine suit was talking about some deal involving
twenty thousand acres Across from Lee was an Ecuadoran man with a long nose and a spot of
red on each cheekbone dressed in a black suit of European cut He was drinking coffee and
eating sweet cakes
Lee drank several cocktails He was getting sicker by the minute Why dont you smoke some
weed Allerton suggested That might help
Good idea Lets go up to the room
Lee smoked a stick of tea on the balcony My god is it cold out on that balcony he said coming
back into the room
   And when twilight falls on the beautiful old colonial city of Quito and those cool breezes steal
down from the Andes walk out in the fresh of the evening and look over the beautiful señoritas
who seat themselves in colorful native costume along the wall of the sixteenthcentury church
that overlooks the main square    They fired the guy wrote that There are limits even in a
travel folder
Tibet must be about like this High and cold and full of uglylooking people and llamas and yaks
Yak milk for breakfast yak curds for lunch and for dinner a yak boiled in his own butter and a
fitting punishment for a yak too if you ask me
You can smell one of those holy men ten miles downwind on a clear day Sitting there pulling on
his old prayer wheel so nasty Wrapped in dirty old burlap sacks with bedbugs crawling around
where his neck sticks out of the sack His nose is all rotted away and he spits betel nut out
through the nose holes like a spitting cobra    Give me that WisdomoftheEast routine
So we got like a holy man and some bitch reporter comes to interview him He sits there chewing
on his betel nut After a while he says to one of his acolytes Go down to the Sacred Well and
bring me a dipper of paregoric Im going to make with the Wisdom of the East And shake the
lead out of your loin cloth So he drinks the PG and goes into a light trance and makes cosmic
contact—we call it going on the nod in the trade The reporter says Will there be war with
Russia Mahatma Will Communism destroy the civilized world Is the soul immortal Does God
exist
The Mahatma opens his eyes and compresses his lips and spits two long red streams of betel
nut juice out through his nose holes It runs down over his mouth and he licks it back in with a
long coated tongue and says How in the fuck should I know The acolyte says You heard the
man Now cut The Swami wants to be alone with his medications Come to think of it that is the
wisdom of the East The Westerner thinks there is some secret he can discover The East says
How the fuck should I know
That night Lee dreamed he was in a penal colony All around were high bare mountains He lived
in a boardinghouse that was never warm He went out for a walk As he stepped off a streetcomer
onto a dirty cobblestone street the cold mountain wind hit him He tightened the belt of his leather
jacket and felt the chill of final despair
Lee woke up and called to Allerton Are you awake Gene
Yes
Cold
Yes
Can I come over with you
Ahh well all right
Lee got in bed with Allerton He was shaking with cold and junk sickness
Youre twitching all over said Allerton Lee pressed against him convulsed by the adolescent
lust of junk sickness
Christ almighty your hands are cold
When Allerton was asleep he rolled over and threw his knee across Lees body Lee lay still so
he wouldnt wake up and move away
The next day Lee was really sick They wandered around Quito The more Lee saw of Quito the
more the place brought him down The town was hilly the streets narrow Allerton stepped off the
high curb and a car grazed him Thank god youre not hurt
Lee said I sure would hate to be stuck in this town
They sat down in a little coffeehouse where some German refugees hung out talking about visas
and extensions and work permits and got into a conversation with a man at the next table The
man was thin and blond his head caved in at the temples Lee could see the blue veins pulsing in
the cold highmountain sunlight that covered the mans weak ravaged face and spilled over the
scarred oak table onto the worn wooden floor Lee asked the man if he liked Quito
To be or not to be that is the question I have to like it
They walked out of the coffeehouse and up the street to a park The trees were stunted by wind
and cold A few boys were rowing around and around in a small pond Lee watched them torn by
lust and curiosity He saw himself desperately rummaging through bodies and rooms and closets
in a frenzied search a recurrent nightmare At the end of the search was an empty room He
shivered in the cold wind
Allerton said Why dont you ask in the coffee shop for the name of a doctor
Thats a good idea
The doctor lived in a yellow stucco villa on a quiet side street He was Jewish with a smooth red
face and spoke good English Lee put down a dysentery routine The doctor asked a few
questions He started to write out a prescription Lee said The prescription that works best is
paregoric with bismuth
The doctor laughed He gave Lee a long look Finally he said Tell the truth now He raised a
forefinger smiling Are you addicted to opiates Better you tell me Otherwise I cannot help you
Lee said Yes
Ah ha said the doctor and he crumpled up the prescription he was writing and dropped it in the
wastebasket He asked Lee how long the addiction had lasted He shook his head looking at
Lee
Ach he said you are a young person You must stop this habit So you lose your life Better
you should suffer now than continue this habit The doctor gave Lee a long human look
My god Lee thought what you have to put up with in this business He nodded and said Of
course Doctor and I want to stop But I have to get some sleep I am going to the coast
tomorrow to Manta
The doctor sat back in his chair smiling You must stop this habit He ran through the routine
again Lee nodded abstractedly Finally the doctor reached for his prescription pad three ccs of
tincture
The drugstore gave Lee paregoric instead of tincture Three ccs of PG Less than a
teaspoonful Nothing Lee bought a bottle of antihistamine tablets and took a handful They
seemed to help a little
Lee and Allerton took a plane the next day for Manta
The Hotel Continental in Manta was made of split bamboo and rough boards Lee found some
knotholes in the wall of their room and plugged the holes up with paper We dont want to get
deported under a cloud he said to Allerton Im a little junk sick you know and that makes me
sooo sexy The neighbors could witness some innaresting sights
I wish to register a complaint concerning breach of contract said Allerton You said twice a
week
So I did Well of course the contract is more or less elastic you might say But you are right
Twice a week it is sire Of course if you get hot pants between times dont hesitate to let me
know
Ill give you a buzz
The water was just right for Lee who could not stand cold water There was no shock when he
plunged in They swam for an hour or so then sat on the beach looking at the sea Allerton could
sit for hours doing absolutely nothing He said That boat out there has been warming up for the
past hour
I am going into town to dig the local bodegas and buy a bottle of cognac Lee told him
The town looked old with limestone streets and dirty saloons crowded with sailors and
dockworkers A shoeshine boy asked Lee if he wanted a nice girl Lee looked at the boy and
said in English No and I dont want you either
He bought a bottle of cognac from a Turkish trader The store had everything ship stores
hardware guns food liquor Lee priced the guns three hundred dollars for a 3030 leveraction
Winchester carbine that sold for seventytwo dollars in the States The Turk said duty was high on
guns That was the reason for this price
Lee walked back along the beach The houses were all split bamboo on wood frame the four
posts set directly in the ground The simplest type of house construction you set four heavy posts
deep in the ground and nail the house to the posts The houses were built about six feet off the
ground The streets were mud Thousands of vultures roosted on the houses and walked around
the streets pecking at offal Lee kicked at a vulture and the bird flapped away with an indignant
squawk
Lee passed a bar a large building built directly on the ground and decided to go in for a drink
The splitbamboo walls shook with noise Two middleaged wiry little men were doing an obscene
mambo routine opposite each other their leathery faces creased in toothless smiles The waiter
came up and smiled at Lee He didnt have any front teeth either Lee sat down on a short wood
bench and ordered a cognac A boy of sixteen or so came over and sat down with Lee and smiled
an open friendly smile Lee smiled back and ordered a refresco for the boy He dropped a hand
on Lees thigh and squeezed it in thanks for the drink The boy had uneven teeth crowded one
over the other but he was a young boy Lee looked at him speculatively; he couldnt figure the
score Was the boy giving him a comeon or wars he just friendly He knew that people in the
Latin American countries were not selfconscious about physical contact Boys walked around
with their arms around each others necks Lee decided to play it cool He finished his drink
shook hands with the boy and walked back to the hotel
Allerton was still sitting on the porch in his swimming trunks and a shortsleeved yellow shirt
which flapped around his thin body in the evening wind Lee went inside to the kitchen and
ordered ice and water and glasses He told Allerton about the Turk the town and the boy Lets
go dig that bar after dinner he said
And get felt up by those young boys said Allerton I should say not
Lee laughed He was feeling surprisingly well The antihistamine cut his junk sickness to a vague
malaise something he would not have noticed if he did not know what it was He looked out over
the bay red in the setting sun Boats of all sizes were anchored in the bay Lee wanted to buy a
boat and sail up and down the coast Allerton liked the idea
While we are in Ecuador we must score for Yage Lee said Think of it thought control Take
anyone apart and rebuild to your taste Anything about somebody bugs you you say Yage I
want that routine took clear out of his mind I could think of a few changes I might make in you
doll He looked at Allerton and licked his lips Youd be so much nicer after a few alterations
Youre nice now of course but you do have those irritating little peculiarities I mean you wont
do exactly what I want you to do all the time
Do you think there is anything in it really Allerton asked
The Russians seem to think so I understand Yage is the most efficient confession drug They
have also used peyote Ever try it
No
Horrible stuff Made me sick like I wanted to die I got to puke and I cant Just excruciating
spasms of the asparagras or whatever you call that gadget Finally the peyote conies up solid
like a ball of hair solid all the way up clogging my throat As nasty a sensation as I ever stood
still for The high is interesting but hardly worth the sick stage Your face swells around the eyes
and the lips swell and you look and feel like an Indian or what you figure an Indian feels like
Primitive you understand Colors are more intense but somehow flat and twodimensional
Everything looks like a peyote plant There is a nightmare undercurrent
I had nightmares after using it one after the other every time I went back to sleep In one dream
I had rabies and looked in the mirror and my face changed and I began howling Another dream I
had a chlorophyll habit Me and five other chlorophyll addicts are waiting to score We turn green
and we cant kick the chlorophyll habit One shot and you are hung for life We are turning into
plants You know anything about psychiatry Schizophrenia
Not much
In some cases of schizophrenia a phenomenon occurs known as automatic obedience I say
Stick out your tongue and you cant keep yourself from obeying Whatever I say whatever
anyone says you must do Get the picture A pretty picture isnt it so long as you are the one
giving the orders that are automatically obeyed Automatic obedience synthetic schizophrenia
massproduced to order That is the Russian dream and America is not far behind The
bureaucrats of both countries want the same thing Control The superego the controlling
agency gone cancerous and berserk Incidentally there is a connection between schizophrenia
and telepathy Schizos are very telepathically sensitive but are strictly receivers Dig the tiein
But you wouldnt know Yage if you saw it
Lee thought a minute Much as I dislike the idea I will have to go back to Quito and talk to a
botanist at the Botanical Institute there
Im not going back to Quito for anything said Allerton
Im not going right away I need some rest and I want to kick the Chinaman all the way out No
need for you to go You stay on the beach Papa will go and get the info
From Manta they flew on to Guayaquil The road was flooded so the only way to get there was
by plane or boat
Guayaquil is built along a river a city with many parks and squares and statues The parks are
full of tropical trees and shrubs and vines A tree that fans out like an umbrella as wide as it is
tall shades the stone benches The people do a great deal of sitting
One day Lee got up early and went to the market The place was crowded A curiously mixed
populace Negro Chinese Indian European Arab characters difficult to classify Lee saw some
beautiful boys of mixed Chinese and Negro stock slender and graceful with beautiful white teeth
A hunchback with withered legs was playing crude bamboo panpipes a mournful Oriental music
with the sadness of the high mountains In deep sadness there is no place for sentimentality It is
as final as the mountains a fact There it is When you realize it you cannot complain
People crowded around the musician listened a few minutes and walked on Lee noticed a
young man with the skin tight over his small face looking exactly like a shrunken head He could
not have weighed more than ninety pounds
The musician coughed from time to time Once he snarled when someone touched his hump
showing his black rotten teeth Lee gave the man a few coins He walked on looking at every
face he passed looking into doorways and up at the windows of cheap hotels An iron bedstead
painted light pink a shirt out to dry    scraps of life Lee snapped at them hungrily like a
predatory fish cut off from his prey by a glass wall He could not stop ramming his nose against
the glass in the nightmare search of his dream And at the end he was standing in a dusty room
in the late afternoon sun with an old shoe in his hand
The city like all Ecuador produced a curiously baffling impression Lee felt there was something
going on here some undercurrent of life that was hidden from him This was the area of the
ancient Chimu pottery where salt shakers and water pitchers were nameless obscenities two
men on all fours engaged in sodomy formed the handle for the top of a kitchen pot
What happens when there is no limit What is the fate of The Land Where Anything Goes Men
changing into huge centipedes    centipedes besieging the houses  a man tied to a couch and
a centipede ten feet long rearing up over him Is this literal Did some hideous metamorphosis
occur What is the meaning of the centipede symbol
Lee got on a bus and rode to the end of the line He took another bus He rode out to the river
and drank a soda and watched some boys swimming in the dirty river The river looked as if
nameless monsters might rise from the greenbrown water Lee saw a lizard two feet long run up
the opposite bank
He walked back towards town He passed a group of boys on a corner One of the boys was so
beautiful that the image cut Lees senses like a wire whip A slight involuntary sound of pain
escaped from Lees lips He turned around as though looking at the street name The boy was
laughing at some joke a highpitched laugh happy and gay Lee walked on
Six or seven boys aged twelve to fourteen were playing in a heap of rubbish on the waterfront
One of the boys was urinating against a post and smiling at the other boys The boys noticed Lee
Now their play was overtly sexual with an undercurrent of mockery They looked at Lee and
whispered and laughed Lee looked at them openly a cold hard stare of naked lust He felt the
tearing ache of limitless desire
He focused on one boy the image sharp and clear as if seen through a telescope with the other
boys and the waterfront blacked out The boy vibrated with life like a young animal A wide grin
showed sharp white teeth Under the torn shirt Lee glimpsed the thin body
He could feel himself in the body of the boy Fragmentary memories    the smell of cocoa beans
drying in the sun bamboo tenements the warm dirty river the swamps and rubbish heaps on the
outskirts of the town He was with the other boys sitting on the stone floor of a deserted house
The roof was gone The stone walls were falling down Weeds and vines grew over the walls and
stretched across the floor
The boys were taking down their torn pants Lee lifted his thin buttocks to slip down his pants He
could feel the stone floor He had his pants down to his ankles His knees were clasped together
and the other boys were trying to pull them apart He gave in and they held his knees open He
looked at them and smiled and slipped his hand down over his stomach Another boy who was
standing up dropped his pants and stood there with his hands on his hips looking down at his
erect organ
A boy sat down by Lee and reached over between his legs Lee felt the orgasm blackout in the
hot sun He stretched out and threw his arm over his eyes Another boy rested his head on his
stomach Lee could feel the warmth of the others head itching a little where the hair touched
Lees stomach
Now he was in a bamboo tenement An oil lamp lit a womans body Lee could feel desire for the
woman through the others body Im not queer he thought Im disembodied
Lee walked on thinking What can I do Take them back to my hotel They are willing enough
For a few Sucres  He felt a killing hate for the stupid ordinary disapproving people who kept
him from doing what he wanted to do Someday I am going to have things just like I want he
said to himself And if any moralizing son of a bitch gives me any static they will fish him out of
the river
Lees plan involved a river He lived on the river and ran things to please himself He grew his
own weed and poppies and cocaine and he had a young native boy for an allpurpose servant
Boats were moored in the dirty river Great masses of water hyacinths floated by The river was a
good halfmile across
Lee walked up to a little park There was a statue of Bolivar The Liberating Fool as Lee called
him shaking hands with someone else Both of them looked tired and disgusted and rocking
queer so queer it rocked you Lee stood looking at the statue Then he sat down on a stone
bench facing the river Everyone looked at Lee when he sat down Lee looked back He did not
have the American reluctance to meet the gaze of a stranger The others looked away and lit
cigarettes and resumed their conversations
Lee sat there looking at the dirty yellow river He couldnt see half an inch under the surface
From time to time small fish jumped ahead of a boat There were trim expensive sailing boats
from the yacht club with hollow masts and beautiful lines There were dugout canoes with
outboard motors and cabins of split bamboo Two old rusty battleships were moored in the middle
of the river—the Ecuadoran Navy Lee sat there a full hour then got up and walked back to the
hotel It was three oclock Allerton was still in bed Lee sat down on the edge of the bed Its
three oclock Gene Time to get up
What for
You want to spend your life in bed Come on out and dig the town with me I saw some beautiful
boys on the waterfront The real uncut boy stuff Such teeth such smiles Young boys vibrating
with life
All right Stop drooling
What have they got that I want Gene Do you know
No
They have maleness of course So have I I want myself the same way I want others Im
disembodied I cant use my own body for some reason He put out his hand Allerton dodged
away
Whats the matter
I thought you were going to run your hand down my ribs
I wouldnt do that Think Im queer or something
Frankly yes
You do have nice ribs Show me the broken one Is that it there Lee ran his hand halfway
down Allertons ribs Or is it further down
Oh go away
But Gene  I am due you know
Yes I suppose you are
Of course if youd rather wait until tonight These tropical nights are so romantic That way we
could take twelve hours or so and do the thing right Lee ran his hands down over Allertons
stomach He could see that Allerton was a little excited
Allerton said Maybe it would be better now You know I like to sleep alone
Yes I know Too bad If I had my way wed sleep every night all wrapped around each other like
hibernating rattlesnakes
Lee was taking off his clothes He lay down beside Allerton Wouldnt it be booful if we should
juth run together into one gweat big blob he said in baby talk Am I giving you the horrors
Indeed you are
Allerton surprised Lee by an unusual intensity of response At the climax he squeezed Lee hard
around the ribs He sighed deeply and closed his eyes
Lee smoothed his eyebrows with his thumbs Do you mind that he asked
Not terribly
But you do enjoy it sometimes The whole deal I mean
Oh yes
Lee lay on his back with one cheek against Allertons shoulder and went to sleep
Lee decided to apply for a passport before leaving Guayaquil He was changing clothes to visit
the embassy and talking to Allerton Wouldnt do to wear high shoes The Consul is probably an
elegant pansy    My dear can you believe it High shoes I mean real old buttonhooky shoes
I simply couldnt take my eyes off those shoes Im afraid I have no idea what he wanted
I hear they are purging the State Department of queers If they do they will be operating with a
skeleton staff    ah here they areLee was putting on a pair of low shoes Imagine walking in
on the Consul and asking him right out for money to eat on  He rears back and claps a scented
handkerchief over his mouth as if you had dropped a dead lobster on his desk Youre broke
Really I dont know why you come to me with this revolting disclosure You might show a
modicum of consideration You must realize how distasteful this sort of thing is Have you no
pride
Lee turned to Allerton How do I look Dont want to look too good or he will be trying to get in
my pants Maybe youd better go That way well get our passports by tomorrow
Listen to this Lee was reading from a
Guayaquil paper It seems that the Peruvian delegates at the antituberculosis congress in
Salinas appeared at the meeting carrying huge maps on which were shown the parts of Ecuador
appropriated by Peru in the 1939 war The Ecuadoran doctors might go to the meeting twirling
shrunken heads of Peruvian soldiers on their watch chains
Allerton had found an article about the heroic fight put up by Ecuadors wolves of the sea
Their what
Thats what it says Lobos del Mar It seems that one officer stuck by his gun even though the
mechanism was no longer operating
Sounds simpleminded to me
They decided to look for a boat in Las Playas Las Playas was cold and the water was rough and
muddy a dreary middleclass resort The food was terrible but the room without meals was
almost the same as full pensión They tried one lunch A plate of rice without sauce without
anything Allerton said I am hurt A tasteless soup with some fibrous material floating in it that
looked like soft white wood The main course was a nameless meat as impossible to identify as
to eat
Lee said The cook has barricaded himself in the kitchen He is shoving this slop out through a
slot The food was as a matter of fact passed out through a slot in a door from a dark smoky
room where presumably it was being prepared
They decided they would go on to Salinas the next day That night Lee wanted to go to bed with
Allerton but he refused and the next morning Lee said he was sorry he asked so soon after the
last time which was a breach of contract
Allerton said I dont like people who apologize at breakfast
Lee said Really Gene arent you taking an unfair advantage Like someone was junk sick and I
dont use junk I say Sick really I dont know why you tell me about your disgusting condition
You might at least have the decency to keep it to yourself if you are sick I hate sick people You
must realize how distasteful it is to see you sneezing and yawning and retching Why dont you go
someplace where I wont have to look at you Youve no idea how tiresome you are or how
disgusting Have you no pride
Allerton said That isnt fair at all
It isnt supposed to be fair Just a routine for your amusement containing a modicum of truth
Hurry and finish your breakfast Well miss the Salinas bus
Salinas had the quiet dignified air of an upperclass resort town They had come in the off
season When they went to swim they found out why this was not the season the Humboldt
current makes the water cold during the summer months Allerton put his foot in the water and
said Its nothing but cold and refused to go in Lee plunged in and swam for a few minutes
Time seemed to speed up in Salinas Lee would eat lunch and lie on the beach After a period
that seemed like an hour or at most two hours he saw the sun low in the sky six oclock Allerton
reported the same experience
Lee went to Quito to get information on the Yage Allerton stayed in Salinas Lee was back five
days later
Yage is also known to the Indians as Ayahuasca Scientific name is Bannisteria caapi Lee
spread a map out on the bed It grows in high jungle on the Amazon side of the Andes We will
go on to Puyo That is the end of the road We should be able to locate someone there who can
deal with the Indians and get the Yage
They spent a night in Guayaquil Lee got drunk before dinner and slept through a movie They
went back to the hotel to go to bed and get an early start in the morning Lee poured himself
some brandy and sat down on the edge of Allertons bed You look sweet tonight he said
taking off his glasses How about a little kiss Huh
Oh go away said Allerton
Okay kid if you say so Theres plenty of time Lee poured some more brandy in his glass and
lay down on his own bed
You know Gene not only have they got poor people in this jerkwater country They also got like
rich people I saw some on the train going up to Quito I expect they keep a plane revved up in
the back yard I can see them loading television sets and radios and golf clubs and tennis rackets
and shotguns into the plane and then trying to boot a prize Brahma bull in on top of the other
junk so the windup is the plane wont get off the ground
Its a small unstable undeveloped country Economic setup exactly the way I figured it all raw
materials lumber food labor rent very cheap All manufactured goods very high because of
import duty The duty is supposed to protect Ecuadoran industry There is no Ecuadoran industry
No production here The people who can produce wont produce because they dont want any
money tied up here They want to be ready to pull out right now with a bundle of cold cash
preferably US dollars They are unduly alarmed Rich people are generally frightened I dont
know why Something to do with a guilt complex I imagine ¿Quién sabe I have not come to
psychoanalyze Caesar but to protect his person At a price of course What they need here is a
security department to keep the underdog under
Yes said Allerton We must secure uniformity of opinion
Opinion What are we running here a debating society Give me one year and the people wont
have any opinions Now just fall in line here folks for your nice tasty stew of fish heads and rice
and oleomargarine And over here for your ration of free lush laced with opium So if they get out
of line we jerk the junk out of the lush and theyre all lying around shitting in their pants too weak
to move An eating habit is the worst habit you can have Another angle is malaria A debilitating
affliction tailormade to water down the revolutionary spirit
Lee smiled Just imagine some old humanist German doctor I say Well Doc you done a great
job here with malaria Cut the incidence down almost to nothing
Ach yes We do our best is it not You see this line in the graph The line shows the decline in
this sickness in the past ten years since we commence with our treatment program
Yeah Doc Now look I want to see that line go back where it came from
Ach this you cannot mean
And another thing See if you cant import an especially debilitating strain of hookworm
The mountain people we can always immobilize by taking their blankets away leaving them with
the enterprise of a frozen lizard
The inside wall to Lees room stopped about three feet from the ceiling to allow for ventilating the
next room which was an inside room with no windows The occupant of the next room said
something in Spanish to the effect Lee should be quiet
Ah shut up said Lee leaping to his feet Ill nail a blanket over that slot Ill cut off your fucking
air You only breathe with my permission Youre the occupant of an inside room a room without
windows So remember your place and shut your povertystricken mouth
A stream of chingas and cabrones replied
Hombre Lee asked ¿En dónde está su cultura
Lets hit the sack said Allerton Im tired
They took a river boat to Babahoya Swinging in hammocks sipping brandy and watching the
jungle slide by Springs moss beautiful clear streams and trees up to two hundred feet high Lee
and Allerton were silent as the boat powered upriver penetrating the jungle stillness with its
lawnmower whine From Babahoya they took a bus over the Andes to Ambato a cold jolting
fourteenhour ride They stopped for a snack of chickpeas at a hut at the top of the mountain
pass far above the tree line A few young native men in gray felt hats ate their chickpeas in sullen
resignation Several guinea pigs were squeaking and scurrying around on the dirt floor of the hut
Their cries reminded Lee of the guinea pig he owned as a child in the Fairmont Hotel in St
Louis when the family was waiting to move into their new house on Price Road He remembered
the way the pig shrieked and the stink of its cage
They passed the snowcovered peak of Chimborazo cold in the moonlight and the constant wind
of the high Andes The view from the high mountain pass seemed from another larger planet
than Earth Lee and Allerton huddled together under a blanket drinking brandy the smell of wood
smoke in their nostrils They were both wearing Armysurplus jackets zipped up over sweatshirts
to keep out the cold and wind Allerton seemed insubstantial as a phantom; Lee could almost see
through him to the empty phantom bus outside
From Ambato to Puyo along the edge of a gorge a thousand feet deep There were waterfalls
and forests and streams running down over the roadway as they descended into the lush green
valley Several times the bus stopped to remove large stones that had slid down onto the road
Lee was talking on the bus to an old prospector named Morgan who had been thirty years in the
jungle Lee asked him about Ayahuasca
Acts on them like opium Morgan said All my Indians use it Cant get any work out of them for
three days when they get on Ayahuasca
I think there may be a market for it Lee said
Morgan said I can get any amount
They passed the prefabricated bungalows of Shell Mara The Shell Company had spent two
years and twenty million dollars found no oil and pulled out They got into Puyo late at night and
found a room in a ramshackle hotel near the general store
Lee and Allerton were too exhausted to speak and they fell asleep at once
Next day Old Man Morgan went around with Lee trying to score for Ayahuasca Allerton was still
sleeping They hit a wall of evasion One man said he would bring some the following day Lee
knew he would not bring any
They went to a little saloon run by a mulatto woman She pretended not to know what Ayahuasca
was Lee asked if Ayahuasca was illegal No said Morgan but the people are suspicious of
strangers
They sat there drinking aguardiente mixed with hot water and sugar and cinnamon Lee said his
racket was shrunkdown heads Morgan figured they could start a headshrinking plant Heads
rolling off the assembly line he said You cant buy those heads at any price The government
forbids it you know The blighters were killing people to sell the heads
Morgan had an inexhaustible fund of old dirty jokes He was talking about some local character
from Canada
How did he get down here Lee asked
Morgan chuckled How did we all get down here Spot of trouble in our own country right
Lee nodded without saying anything
Old Man Morgan went back to Shell Mara on the afternoon bus to collect some money owed him
Lee talked to a Dutchman named Sawyer who was farming near Puyo Sawyer told him there
was an American botanist living in the jungle a few hours out of Puyo
He is trying to develop some medicine I forget the name If he succeeds in concentrating this
medicine he says he will make a fortune Now he is having a hard time He has nothing to eat out
there
Lee said I am interested in medicinal plants I may pay him a visit
He will be glad to see you But take along some flour or tea or something They have nothing out
there
Later Lee said to Allerton A botanist What a break He is our man We will go tomorrow
We can hardly pretend we just happened by said Allerton How are you going to explain your
visit
I will think of something Best tell him right out I want to score for Yage I figure maybe there is a
buck in it for both of us According to what I hear he is flat on his ass We are lucky to hit him in
that condition If he was in the chips and drinking champagne out of galoshes in the whorehouses
of Puyo he would hardly be interested to sell me a few hundred Sucres worth of Yage And
Gene for the love of Christ when we do overhaul this character please dont say Doctor Cotter
I presume
The hotel room in Puyo was damp and cold The houses across the street were blurred by the
pouring rain like a city under water Lee was picking up articles off the bed and shoving them into
a rubberized sack A 32 automatic pistol some cartridges wrapped in oiled silk a small frying
pan tea and flour packed in cans and sealed with adhesive tape two quarts of Puro
Allerton said This booze is the heaviest item and the bottles got like sharp edges Why dont
we leave it here
Well have to loosen his tongue Lee said He picked up the sack and handed Allerton a shiny
new machete
Lets wait till the rain stops said Allerton
Wait till the rain stops Lee collapsed on the bed with loud simulated laughter Haw haw haw
Wait till the rain stops They got a saying down here like Ill pay you what I owe you when it stops
raining in Puyo Haw haw
We had two clear days when we first got here
I know A latterday miracle Theres a movement on foot to canonize the local padre Vámonos
cabrón
Lee slapped Allertons shoulder and they walked out in the rain slipping on the wet cobblestones
of the main street
The trail was corduroy The wood of the trail was covered with a film of mud They cut long canes
to keep from slipping but it was slow walking High jungle with hardwood forest on both sides of
the trail and very little undergrowth Everywhere was water springs and streams and rivers of
clear cold water
Good trout water Lee said
They stopped at several houses to ask where Cotters place was Everyone said they were
headed right How far Two three hours Maybe more Word seemed to have gone ahead One
man they met on the trail shifted his machete to shake hands and said at once You are looking
for Cotter He is in his house now
How far Lee asked
The man looked at Lee and Allerton It will take you about three hours more
They walked on and on It was late afternoon now They flipped a coin to see who would ask at
the next house Allerton lost
He says three more hours Allerton said
We been hearing that for the past six hours
Allerton wanted to rest Lee said No If you rest your legs get stiff Its the worst thing you can
do
Who told you that
Old Man Morgan
Well Morgan or no I am going to rest
Dont make it too long It will be a hell of a note if we get caught short stumbling over snakes
and jaguars in the dark and falling into quebrajas— thats what they call these deep crevices cut
by streams of water Some of them are sixty feet deep and four feet wide Just room enough to
fall in
They stopped to rest in a deserted house The walls were gone but there was a roof that looked
pretty sound We could stop here in a pinch said Allerton looking around
A definite pinch No blankets
It was dark when they reached Cotters place a small thatched hut in a clearing Cotter was a
wiry little man in his middle fifties Lee observed that the reception was a bit cool Lee brought out
the liquor and they all had a drink Cotters wife a large stronglooking redhaired woman made
some tea with cinnamon to cut the kerosene taste of the Puro Lee got drunk on three drinks
Cotter was asking Lee a lot of questions How did you happen to come here Where are you
from How long have you been in Ecuador Who told you about me Are you a tourist or
travelling on business
Lee was drunk He began talking in junky lingo explaining that he was looking for Yage or
Ayahuasca He understood the Russians and the Americans were experimenting with this drug
Lee said he figured there might be a buck in the deal for both of them The more Lee talked the
cooler Cotters manner became The man was clearly suspicious but why or of what Lee could
not decide
Dinner was pretty good considering the chief ingredient was a sort of fibrous root and bananas
After dinner Cotters wife said These boys must be tired Jim
Cotter led the way with a flashlight that developed power by pressing a lever A cot about thirty
inches wide made of bamboo slats I guess you can both make out here he said Mrs Cotter
was spreading a blanket on the cot as a mattress with another blanket as cover Lee lay down on
the cot next to the wall Allerton lay on the outside and Cotter adjusted a mosquito net
Mosquitos Lee asked
No vampire bats Cotter said shortly Good night
Good night
Lees muscles ached from the long walk He was very tired He put one arm across Allertons
chest and snuggled close to the boys body A feeling of deep tenderness flowed out from Lees
body at the warm contact He snuggled closer and stroked Allertons shoulder gently Allerton
moved irritably pushing Lees arm away
Slack off will you and go to sleep said Allerton He turned on his side with his back to Lee
Lee drew his arm back His whole body contracted with the shock Slowly he put his hand under
his cheek He felt a deep hurt as though he were bleeding inside Tears ran down his face
He was standing in front of the Ship Ahoy The place looked deserted He could hear someone
crying He saw his little son and knelt down and took the child in his arms The sound of crying
came closer a wave of sadness and now he was crying his body shaking with sobs
He held little Willy close against his chest A group of people were standing there in convict suits
Lee wondered what they were doing there and why he was crying
When Lee woke up he still felt the deep sadness of his dream He stretched out a hand towards
Allerton then pulled it back He turned around to face the wall
Next morning Lee felt dry and irritable and empty of feeling He borrowed Cotters 22 rifle and
set out with Allerton to have a look at the jungle The jungle seemed empty of life
Cotter says the Indians have cleaned most of the game out of the area said Allerton They all
have shotguns from the money they made working for Shell
They walked along a trail Huge trees some over a hundred feet high matted with vines cut off
the sunlight
May God grant we kill some living creature Lee said Gene I hear something squawking over
there Im going to try and shoot it
What is it
How should I know Its alive isnt it
Lee pushed through the undergrowth beside the trail He tripped on a vine and fell into a sawtoothed
plant When he tried to get up a hundred sharp points caught his clothes and stuck into
his flesh
Gene he called Help me I been seized by a maneating plant Gene cut me free with the
machete
They did not see a living animal in the jungle
Cotter was supposedly trying to find a way to extract curare from the arrow poison the Indians
used He told Lee there were yellow crows to be found in the region and yellow catfish with
extremely poisonous spines His wife had gotten spined and Cotter had to administer morphine
for the intense pain He was a medical doctor
Lee was struck by the story of the Monkey Woman a brother and sister had come down to this
part of Ecuador to live the simple healthful life on roots and berries and nuts and palm hearts
Two years later a searchparty had found them hobbling along on improvised crutches toothless
and suffering from halfhealed fractures It seems there was no calcium in the area Chickens
couldnt lay eggs there was nothing to form the shell Cows gave milk but it was watery and
translucent with no calcium in it
The brother went back to civilization and steaks but the Monkey Woman was still there She
earned her monicker by watching what monkeys ate anything a monkey eats she can eat
anybody can eat Its a handy thing to know if you get lost in the jungle Also handy to bring along
some calcium tablets Even Cotters wife had lost her teeth inna thervith His were long gone
He had a fivefoot viper guarding his house from prowlers after his precious curare notes He also
had two tiny monkeys cute but illtempered and equipped with sharp little teeth and a twotoed
sloth Sloths live on fruit in trees swinging along upside down and making a sound like a crying
baby On the ground they are helpless This one just lay there and thrashed about and hissed
Cotter warned them not to touch it even on the back of the neck since it could reach around with
its strong sharp claws and drive them through ones hand then pull it to its mouth and start
biting
Cotter was evasive when Lee asked about Ayahuasca He said he was not sure Yage and
Ayahuasca were the same plant Ayahuasca was connected with Brujena—witchcraft He himself
was a white Brujo He had access to Brujo secrets Lee had no such access
It would take you years to gain their confidence
Lee said he did not have years to spend on the deal Cant you get me some he asked
Cotter looked at him sourly I have been out here three years he said
Lee tried to come on like a scientist I want to investigate the properties of this drug he said I
am willing to take some as an experiment
Cotter said Well I could take you down to Canela and talk to the Brujo He will give you some if
I say so
That would be very kind said Lee
Cotter did not say any more about going to Canela He did say a lot about how short they were on
supplies and how he had no time to spare from his experiments with a curare substitute After
three days Lee saw he was wasting time and told Cotter they were leaving Cotter made no
attempt to conceal his relief
Epilogue
Mexico City Return
Every time I hit Panama the place is exactly one month two months six months more nowhere
like the course of a degenerative illness A shift from arithmetical to geometrical progression
seems to have occurred Something ugly and ignoble and subhuman is cooking in this mongrel
town of pimps and whores and recessive genes this degraded leech on the Canal
A smog of bum kicks hangs over Panama in the wet heat Everyone here is telepathic on the
paranoid level I walked around with my camera and saw a wood and corrugated iron shack on a
limestone cliff in Old Panama like a penthouse I wanted a picture of this excrescence with the
albatrosses and vultures wheeling over it against the hot gray sky My hands holding the camera
were slippery with sweat and my shirt stuck to my body like a wet condom
An old hag in the shack saw me taking the picture They always know when you are taking their
picture especially in Panama She went into an angry consultation with some other rattylooking
people I could not see clearly Then she walked to the edge of a perilous balcony and made an
ambiguous gesture of hostility Many socalled primitives are afraid of cameras There is in fact
something obscene and sinister about photography a desire to imprison to incorporate a sexual
intensity of pursuit I walked on and shot some boys—young alive unconscious— playing
baseball They never glanced in my direction
Down by the waterfront I saw a dark young Indian on a fishing boat He knew I wanted to take his
picture and every time I swung the camera into position he would look up with young male
sulkiness I finally caught him leaning against the bow of the boat with languid animal grace idly
scratching one shoulder A long white scar across right shoulder and collarbone I put away my
camera and leaned over the hot concrete wall looking at him In my mind I was running a finger
along the scar down across his naked copper chest and stomach every cell aching with
deprivation I pushed away from the wall muttering
Oh Jesus and walked away looking around for something to photograph
A Negro with a felt hat was leaning on the porch rail of a wooden house built on a dirty limestone
foundation I was across the street under a movie marquee Every time I prepared my camera he
would lift his hat and look at me muttering insane imprecations I finally snapped him from behind
a pillar On a balcony over this character a shirtless young man was washing I could see the
Negro and Near Eastern blood in him the rounded face and caféaulait mulatto skin the smooth
body of undifferentiated flesh with not a muscle showing He looked up from his washing like an
animal scenting danger I caught him when the five oclock whistle blew An old photographers
trick wait for a distraction
I went into Chicos Bar for a rum Coke I never liked this place nor any other bar in Panama but
it used to be endurable and had some good numbers on the juke box Now there was nothing but
this awful Oklahoma honkytonk music like the bellowings of an anxious cow Youre Drivin
Nails in my Coffin— It Wasnt God Made Honky Tonk Angels—Your Cheatin Heart
The servicemen in the joint all had that lightconcussion Canal Zone look cowlike and blunted
as if they had undergone special GI processing and were immunized against contact on the
intuition level telepathic sender and receiver excised You ask them a question they answer
without friendliness or hostility No warmth no contact Conversation is impossible They just
have nothing to say They sit around buying drinks for the Bgirls making lifeless passes which
the girls brush off like flies and playing that whining music on the juke box One young man with
a pimply adenoidal face kept trying to touch a girls breast She would brush his hand away then
it would creep back as if endowed with autonomous insect life A Bgirl sat next to me and I
bought her one drink She ordered good Scotch yet Panama how I hate your cheatin guts I
thought She had a shallow bird brain and perfect Stateside English like a recording Stupid
people can learn a language quick and easy because there is nothing going on in there to keep it
out
She wanted another drink I said No She said Why are you so mean I said Look if I run
out of money who is going to buy my drinks Will you
She looked surprised and said slowly Yes You are right Excuse me
I walked down the main drag A pimp seized my arm I gotta fourteenyearold girl Jack Puerto
Rican Hows about it
Shes middleaged already I told him I want a sixyearold virgin and none of that sealedwhile
youwait shit Dont try palming your old fourteenyearold bats off on me I left him there
with his mouth open
I went into a store to price some Panama hats The young man behind the counter started
singing Making friends losing money
This spic bastard is strictly on the chisel I decided
He showed me some twodollar hats Fifteen dollar he said
Your prices are way out of line I told him and turned and walked out He followed me onto the
street Just a minute Mister I walked on
That night I had a recurrent dream I was back in Mexico City talking to Art Gonzalez a former
roommate of Allertons I asked him where Allerton was and he said In Agua Diente This was
somewhere south of Mexico City and I was inquiring about a bus connection I have dreamed
many times I was back in Mexico City talking to Art or Allertons best friend Johnny White and
asking where he was
I flew up to Mexico City I was a little nervous going through the airport; some cop or Immigration
inspector might spot me I decided to stick close to the attractive young tourist I had met on the
plane I had packed my hat and when I got off the plane I took off my glasses I slung my camera
over my shoulder
Lets take a cab into town Split the fare Cheaper that way I said to my tourist We walked
through the airport like father and son Yes I was saying that old boy in Guatemala wanted to
charge me two dollars from the Palace Hotel out to the airport I told him uno I held up one
finger No one looked at us Two tourists
We got into a taxi The driver said twelve pesos for both to the center of town
Wait a minute the tourist said in English No meter Where your meter You got to have a
meter
The driver asked me to explain that he was authorized to carry airline passengers to town without
a meter
No the tourist shouted I not tourist I live in Mexico City ¿Sabe Hotel Colmena I live in Hotel
Colmena Take me to town but I pay what is on meter I call police Policía Youre required by
law to have a meter
Oh God I thought Thats all I need this jerk should call the law I could see cops
accumulating around the cab not knowing what to do and calling other cops The tourist got out
of the cab with his suitcase He was taking down the number
I call policía plenty quick he said
I said Well I think Ill take this cab anyway Wont get into town much cheaper    Vámonos I
said to the driver
I checked into an eightpeso hotel near Sears and walked over to Lolas my stomach cold with
excitement The bar was in a different place redecorated with new furniture But there was the
same old bartender behind the bar with his gold tooth and his moustache
¿Cómo está he said We shook hands He asked where I had been and I told him South
America I sat down with a Delaware Punch The place was empty but someone I knew was
bound to come in sooner or later
The Major walked in A retired Army man grayhaired vigorous stocky I ran through the list
crisply with the Major
Johnny White Russ Morton Pete Crowly Ike Scranton
Los Angeles Alaska Idaho dont know still around Hes always around
And oh uh whatever happened to Allerton
Allerton Dont believe I know him
See you
Night Lee Take it easy
I walked over to Sears and looked through the magazines In one called Balls For Real Men I
was looking at a photo of a Negro hanging from a tree I Saw Them Swing Sonny Goons A
hand fell on my shoulder I turned and there was Gale another retired Army man He had the
subdued air of the reformed drunk I ran through the list
Most everybody is gone Gale said I never see those guys anyway never hang around Lolas
anymore
I asked about Allerton
Allerton
Tall skinny kid Friend of Johnny White and Art Gonzalez
Hes gone too
How long ago No need to play it cool and casual with Gale He wouldnt notice anything
I saw him about a month ago on the other side of the street
See you
See you
I put the magazine away slowly and walked outside and leaned against a post Then I walked
back to Lolas Burns was sitting at a table drinking a beer with his maimed hand
Hardly anybody around Johnny White and Tex and Crosswheel are in Los Angeles
I was looking at his hand
Did you hear about Allerton he asked
I said No
He went down to South America or some place With an Army colonel Allerton went along as
guide
So How long has he been gone
About six months
Must have been right after I left
Yeah Just about then
I got Art Gonzalezs address from Burns and went over to see him He was drinking a beer in a
shop across from his hotel and called me over Yes Allerton left about five months ago and went
along as guide to a colonel and his wife
They were going to sell the car in Guatemala A 48 Cadillac I felt there was something not quite
right about the deal But Allerton never told me anything definite You know how he is Art
seemed surprised I had not heard from Allerton Nobody has heard anything from him since he
left It worries me
I wondered what he could be doing and where Guatemala is expensive San Salvador
expensive and jerkwater Costa Rica I regretted not having stopped off in San Jose on the way
up
Gonzalez and I went through the whereissoandso routine Mexico City is a terminal of spacetime
travel a waiting room where you grab a quick drink while you wait for your train That is why
I can stand to be in Mexico City or New York You are not stuck there; by the fact of being there
at all you are travelling But in Panama crossroads of the world you are exactly so much aging
tissue You have to make arrangements with Pan Am or the Dutch Line for removal of your body
Otherwise it would stay there and rot in the muggy heat under a galvanized iron roof
That night I dreamed I finally found Allerton hiding out in some Central American backwater He
seemed surprised to see me after all this time In the dream I was a finder of missing persons
Mr Allerton I represent the Friendly Finance Company Havent you forgotten something Gene
Youre supposed to come and see us every third Tuesday Weve been lonely for you in the
office We dont like to say Pay up or else Its not a friendly thing to say I wonder if you have
ever read the contract all the way through I have particular reference to Clause 6x which can
only be deciphered with an electron microscope and a virus filter I wonder if you know just what
or else means Gene
Aw I know how it is with you young kids You get chasing after some floozie and forget all about
Friendly Finance dont you But Friendly Finance doesnt forget you Like the song say No
hiding place down there Not when the old Skip Tracer goes out on a job
The Skip Tracers face went blank and dreamy His mouth fell open showing teeth hard and
yellow as old ivory Slowly his body slid down in the leather armchair until the back of the chair
pushed his hat down over his eyes which gleamed in the hats shade catching points of light like
an opal He began humming Johnnys So Long at the Fair over and over The humming stopped
abruptly in the middle of a phrase
The Skip Tracer was talking in a voice languid and intermittent like music down a windy street
You meet all kinds on this job Kid Every now and then some popcorn citizen walks in the office
and tries to pay Friendly Finance with this shit
He let one arm swing out palm up over the side of the chair Slowly he opened a thin brown
hand with purpleblue fingertips to reveal a roll of yellow thousanddollar bills The hand turned
over palm down and fell back against the chair His eyes closed
Suddenly his head dropped to one side and his tongue fell out The bills dropped from his hand
one after the other and lay there crumpled on the red tile floor A gust of warm spring wind blew
dirty pink curtains into the room The bills rustled across the room and settled at Allertons feet
Imperceptibly the Skip Tracer straightened up and a slit of light went on behind the eyelids
Keep that in case youre caught short Kid he said You know how it is in these spic hotels
You gotta carry your own paper
The Skip Tracer leaned forward his elbows on his knees Suddenly he was standing up as if
tilted out of the chair and in the same upward movement he pushed the hat back from his eyes
with one finger He walked to the door and turned with his right hand on the knob He polished
the nails of his left hand on the lapel of his worn glen plaid suit The suit gave out an odor of mold
when he moved There was mildew under the lapels and in the trouser cuffs He looked at his
nails
Oh uh    about your uh    account Ill be around soon That is within the next few  The
Skip Tracers voice was muffled
Well come to some kind of an agreement Now the voice was loud and clear The door opened
and wind blew through the room The door closed and the curtains settled back one curtain
trailing over a sofa as though someone had taken it and tossed it there
