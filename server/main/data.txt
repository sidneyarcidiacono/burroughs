 desperation is the raw material of drastic change only those who can leave behind
 everything they have ever believed
 in can hope to escape
 when you stop growing you start dying
 language is a virus from outer space
 nothing is true everything is permitted
 a functioning police state needs no police
 this is a war universe war all the time
 that is its nature
 be just and if you cant be just be arbitrary
 the face of evil is always the face of total need
 exterminate all rational thought
 perhaps all pleasure in only relief
 like all pure creatures cats are practical
 sometimes paranoias just having all the facts
 which came first the intestine or the tapeworm
 confusion hath fuck his masterpiece
 never give anything away for nothing
 always take back everything if you possibly can
 most people dont see whats going on around them
 the young are an alien species
 last night i encountered a dream cat
 with a very long neck and body like a
 human fetus
 i don't know how to provide for it
 for gods sake keep your eyes open
 i project myself out through glasses
 and across the street
 americans have a special horror
 of giving up control
 the only possible ethic is to do
 what one wants to do
 your knowledge of what's going on
 can only be superficial
 love what is it most natural painkiller
 every man has inside him a parasitic being
 that is not acting at all to his advantage
 our national drug is alcohol
 regard any other with a special kind of horror
 a functioning police state needs no police
 i woke up with someone squeezing my hand
 it was my other hand
 pregnant women lose their teeth feeding the
 stranger junkies lose their yellow fangs
 feeding the monkey
 junk is the ideal product
 the ultimate merchandise
 in deep sadness there is no place
 for sentimentality
 silence is only frightening to people who are
 compulsively verbalizing
 they boys eat happily
 looking into each others eyes
 blood runs down their chins
 all writing is in fact cutups
 a collage of words read heard overheard
 what else
 the step into space is always a step into the unknown
 o death where is thy sting
 the man is never on time
 always take back everything if you possibly can
 always catch the buyer hungry
 and always make him wait
 the self is like a pimping blackmailing
 chauffeur who gets you from here to there
 on word lines
 how far would people get in physics if
 discovery were described as disgusting
 dream long enough and dream hard enough
 and you will come to know dreaming can
 make it so
