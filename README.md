# burroughs
### A text-generating neural network that simulates question and response with William Burroughs
#### Featuring Two Versions:
##### V 1.0 Powered By Brain.js LSTM Recurrent Neural Network
##### V 2.0 Powered By Keras & Tensorflow

Visit the versions' respective pages to learn more about each model, how it was trained, and why it was used.
Special thanks to the writers at Keras for their resources on character-level text generating with LSTM. This part of the
project made possible by their documentation here: https://keras.io/examples/generative/lstm_character_level_text_generation/
